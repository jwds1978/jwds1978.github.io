  I've heard and/or seen the definition of what a veteran is more times than I care to fucking recall.&nbsp; And, quite frankly, there's only really one
  definition that means shit.&nbsp; As per the VAC, a veteran is:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-definition-of-a-veteran">
    Any former member of the Canadian Armed Forces who successfully underwent basic training and is honourably released.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  When people think of veterans, many immediately picture someone who served within the First World War, the Second World War, and/or the Korean War.&nbsp;
  While many Canadians recognize these traditional veterans, the same isn't always true for Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans &#8212; those who served Canada
  since the Korean War.
