title: "What We Know About Veteran Homelessness in Canada and What's Being Done to Address the Issue"
---

<p>
  Veteran homelessness is a growing issue in Canada.&nbsp; The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 reports that there are 2,950 veterans staying in shelters,
  making up 2.2% of annual shelter users.&nbsp; About 25% of the veteran population in Canada faces difficulties transitioning from military service to civilian
  life &#8212; facing a risk of homelessness, mental illness, and/or addictions.&nbsp; While veterans make up approximately 2% of the Canadian population,
  advocates are concerned with the over-representation of veterans within the homeless population.&nbsp; In Metro Vancouver region's 2014 point-in-time count,
  7% of respondents indicated that they'd served in the Forces.&nbsp; In Toronto, the same percentage was reported in their 2013 Street Needs Assessment.&nbsp;
  Alberta's <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-7-cities" rel="me" title="7 Cities">7 cities</a> &#8212; Calgary, Edmonton, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge,
  Medicine Hat, Red Deer, and Wood Buffalo &#8212; co-ordinated point-in-time count found that, of those surveyed, 6% had military service.&nbsp; In the
  Waterloo region, it was 5%.

<h3 id="demographics">
  Demographics
</h3>
<p>
  In a 2014 study, Forchuk and Richardson found that 92.1% of the veterans they interviewed were men, with an average age of 52 years old.&nbsp; Of those,
  almost 10% were Indigenous and 66% had children.&nbsp; An earlier 2011 study, by Forchuk and Ray, reported that 37% of their research participants were either
  separated or divorced, 42% had a high school education, and 74% identified as Caucasian.&nbsp; The study also showed that many participants had experienced
  chronic homelessness &#8212; on average, over 5 years.&nbsp; For many, there was a significant lag-time between the time that they left the Forces &#8212;
  over 24 years ago &#8212; and, when they first experienced homelessness &#8212; 9.8 years ago &#8212; indicating, a long path into homelessness.
</p>
<p>
  Another study, found that veterans comprised 4.3% of a sample of the adult homeless population with severe mental illness.&nbsp; But, beyond these
  demographical criteria, not much else has been researched.&nbsp; Until further quantitative data is published, no safe assumption can safely be made on the
  approximately
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-general-statistics" rel="me" title="General Statistics">685,000 active and retired Canadian veterans</a>.

  Factors at Play
</h3>
<p>
  Veterans Affairs Canada highlights
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-transition-to-civilian-life" rel="me" title="Transition to Civilian Life">the importance of career transition</a>
  upon returning from service.&nbsp; Veterans themselves, also identified additional challenges, beyond starting a new career.&nbsp; Transitioning to civilian
  life was one of the main factors leading to homelessness &#8212; identified inÂ Ray's 2011 study.&nbsp; One veteran described the transition &quot;like being
  on Mars and coming back to Earth&quot; and another one shared a similar experience:
  <blockquote>
    I was trying to set-up a business at the time, with no financial presence in the civilian world&hellip;&nbsp; Which, made it hard to get loans&hellip;&nbsp;
    I wound up, at that time, homeless&hellip;&nbsp; As a military person, living in barracks, I wasn't entirely prepared for what real finances in the real
    world was like&hellip;&nbsp; All of my expenses came out of my pay cheque&hellip;&nbsp; Boiled down to never having been exposed to the reality of civilian
    finances&hellip;&nbsp; I was rather coddled in the military.&nbsp; Big, big difference&hellip;&nbsp; Like, two completely different worlds&hellip;
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of the time of their release from military service, many veterans have expressed the need for a structured transitional program &#8212; over
  several months &#8212; that can assist them with adapting back to everyday life within their communities.&nbsp; Supports with personal finances, budgeting,
  vocational rehabilitation, family counselling, mental health, substance use, housing, and/or paper work are just some of the supportive services that veterans
  mentioned that they'd like to receive.
</p>
<p>
  This transition can also affect veterans' mental health and substance use.&nbsp; Studies show the prevalence of addiction and mental illness among veterans,
  but especially, for those experiencing homelessness.&nbsp; This could be a contributing factor to their homelessness and/or may have been triggered and/or
  worsened by the stressful realities of not having a home.&nbsp; While 11% of veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), many reported using
  alcohol to deal with their mental health, and some started using while still in the military.
</p>
<p>
  Several key considerations among the veteran population include:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Choice of housing and living arrangement is important.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collaboration includes an integrated and shared response with both homeless and veteran services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Homeless veterans have unique needs within the broader homeless population.
    </li>
    <li>
      Housing first and harm-reduction must be programming philosophies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Peer-support requires knowledge of the military service and homelessness-related issues.
    </li>
    <li>
      Permanent, long-term, housing is preferred over transitional housing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Programs need to be outcome-focused with housing stability as a primary goal.&nbsp; Secondary goals include diversion from emergency services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Structure, routine, and leisure are important.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-national-alliance-to-end-homelessness" rel="me" title="National Alliance to End Homelessness">

  </a>
  identified additional factors, such as
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-fact-sheet-veteran-homelessness" rel="me" title="Fact Sheet: Veteran Homelessness">
    traumatic brain injury, sexual trauma while serving in the military &#8212; especially, for female veterans &#8212; lack of transferable employment skills,
    lack of strong social support networks, shortage of affordable housing options, and low living wage jobs
  </a>.&nbsp;
  These factors, combined with PTSD and/or another mental illness and/or addiction puts veterans at a greater risk of homelessness than the general population.

    HPS and Veterans Affairs Canada are working together

  service providers, to help identity homeless veterans and those at imminent risk in order to connect them with veteran-specific services.

<p>
  Veterans Affairs Canada is planning to open staffed offices in Brandon, Charlottetown, Corner Brook, Kelowna, Prince George, Saskatoon, Surrey, Sydney,
  Thunder Bay, and Windsor by the spring of 2017.&nbsp; At these locations, veterans will be able to access information on supportive services, which include:

    <li>
      Case management.
