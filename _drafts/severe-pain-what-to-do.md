title: "Severe Pain, What to Do"
---

<p>
  The government had issued new guidelines which strongly urge doctors to stop prescribing narcotics to patients with chronic pain.&nbsp; While I believe its
  mandate may reduce deaths from opioid overdose, what the feds haven't considered is the impact on people with long-standing severe pain, especially if they're
  disabled.
