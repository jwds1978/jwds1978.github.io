<p>
  Creating your own Web site may seem hard and complex at first sight.&nbsp; Since the Internet is full of different guides and manuals dedicated to this
  particular topic, some of you may be confused or misled by wrongly interpreted information.
</p>
<p>
  I have a question for you, my dear reader!&nbsp; Aren't you tired of bullshit articles on how to create a Web site?&nbsp; Don't you find them useless and not
  detailed enough?
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I checked numerous articles on this topic, and I found it very annoying when the manual itself looked good but some important details were
  missing.&nbsp; So it looked like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      You take a look at your admin panel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, at the screen capture from the manual, and back at your admin panel&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      Something went wrong.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Basically, that's the reason why I'd decided to work on this article for you.&nbsp; It's time to cut the crap and get it done.&nbsp; This Internet needs a
  hero.&nbsp; Brace yourself, I've prepared an ultimate guide on how to create a Web site for you!
</p>
<img

  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<p>
  Turn off the TV show or movie that you're watching.&nbsp; You're going to finish your Seinfeld episode later.&nbsp; It's time to start creating!
</p>
<p>
  We're about to take-off.&nbsp; Take your seat, it's going to be a long, yet exciting, journey!
</p>

<h3>
  How to Choose a Web Site Platform
</h3>
<p>
  Whenever someone talks about getting a Web site up-and-running, you may hear a 'CMS' abbreviation.&nbsp; This section will explain to you in-detail what a CMS
  is and how you should utilize such a tool.&nbsp; If you already have this basic knowledge, you may just skip this section, and skip ahead in the article.
</p>
<p>
  CMS stands for &quot;content management system&quot;.&nbsp; The main purpose of these systems is helping you manage and modify the content on your Web site
  without touching a single line of code.&nbsp; Basically, the CMS usually includes all of the needed scripts to control your Web site content and to deliver it
  to your Web site visitors.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of different CMSs around.&nbsp; However, within this article, I'll use the most successful and powerful ones.&nbsp; These include:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      WordPress
    </li>
    <li>
      Joomla
    </li>
    <li>
      Drupal
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="271" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/19/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/cms-distribution_482x271.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<p>
  I've gathered the needed information about the aforementioned CMSs for you.
</p>
<p>
  As you may have noticed, WordPress covers more than a half of the Web sites on the Internet.&nbsp; Millions of Web developers choose WordPress as their
  primary Web site building platform.
</p>
<p>
  The difference between first and second place is huge, right?&nbsp; Joomla and Drupal hold the second and third places with the proud numbers (10% and
  9%).&nbsp; Let's see why Web developers choose WordPress and why it's better than any other CMS.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
  The Better CMS
</h3>
<p>
  Some of you may say that WordPress is just about blogging Web sites and magazines.&nbsp; That's a common misconception.&nbsp; Nowadays, this platform offers
  you much more functionality.
</p>
<p>
  You can use WordPress to start a blog, eCommerce store, landing page, magazine, portfolio, and more&hellip;&nbsp; You can do, literally, most nything.&nbsp;
  This CMS is flexible enough to start a project of any size and complexity.
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="141" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/19/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/WordPress_web-sites_482x141.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<p>
  A lot of large projects are built with WordPress.&nbsp; For example:
  <ul>
    <li>
      BBC America
    </li>
    <li>
      New Yorker
    </li>
    <li>
      Variety
    </li>
    <li>
      Wired
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The credit given by these big brands can be easily explained by the multi-functionality and simplicity of WordPress.&nbsp; It doesn't matter whether you're
  trying to build a Web site for your company or just a small blog for yourself to post news about how good was your breakfast today.&nbsp; WordPress will work
  fine for everything.
</p>
<p>
  Here are the key WordPress benefits:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ease of Use
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personally, I'd say that &quot;take it easy&quot; is an unofficial WordPress slogan which inspires the developers of this CMS to build such a great
          product.&nbsp; You'll not need big 500-page books to study on how to use this CMS.&nbsp; You'll be guided through the installation process by the CMS
          itself.&nbsp; How cool is that, eh?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Then you'll be able to add the functions that you like by adding plug-ins through the admin panel.&nbsp; Each of them can be configured within a few
          clicks.&nbsp; You can go live with your Web site in the blink of an eye.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Truly Responsive and Mobile-Friendly
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once you install WordPress and kick it off with your newly created Web site, you'll not have to worry about how your Web site looks on mobile
          devices.&nbsp; The major part of WordPress themes nowadays, is built with all of the latest standards, giving you a possibility to convey your content
          to your audience through mobile devices in the most efficient way.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Just take a look at the best sellers demos and check-out how they look on smart phones and/or tablets.&nbsp; They're specifically designed to meet
          your cross-platform expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      WordPress Web Sites Look Stunning
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is pretty simple&hellip;&nbsp; It really is beautiful.&nbsp; If you don't believe me, feel free to check-out the catalog of the
          <a href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" target="_blank">premium WordPress themes</a> and you'll see what I'm talking about.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These are the key benefits that should be of interest to you if you're a newbie and you're trying to select the correct CMS.&nbsp; Of course, there are plenty
  of other pros in WordPress, but I wouldn't want this article to become all about those though.&nbsp; Let's move on.
</p>
<p>
  Drupal and Joomla are less popular amongst Web developers, but they've still got their market share and their own fans anyhow.&nbsp; I've, intentionally,
  included Drupal and Joomla in one section.&nbsp; They both have very similar cons when compared with WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  One of the biggest problems with these types of systems is their complexity.&nbsp; It's simply harder to work with them&hellip;&nbsp; You need to have a more
  advanced level and knowledge to be able to build a fully-functional and good looking Web site.
</p>
<p>
  All the same, they're listed in the top-3 for a reason.&nbsp; That's why I've decided to provide you with not only one, but three guides.&nbsp; That's right,
  I'll show you how you can create a Web site using any one of these three platforms.
</p>
<p>
  For your convenience, you can decide which CMS works the best for you, depending on your skill and knowledge, and skip to the relevant section of the article.
</p>
<p>

<h3>
  Choosing a Domain and Web Hosting
</h3>
<p>
  Each and every Web site needs a domain name and Web hosting.&nbsp; That's like a home for your Web site.&nbsp; Everybody needs a home, right?
</p>
<p>
  I'm not going to tell you about the possibility to be hosted at wordpress.com for free&hellip;&nbsp; I'm a serious person.&nbsp; Using a subdomain of
  wordpress.com will make your Web site look unprofessional.&nbsp; That's not what we're trying to do.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of Web hosting providers around the Internet.&nbsp; The pricing varies from being as low as Hell to being ridiculously high.&nbsp;
  Personally, I'd suggest that you considering the two Web hosting providers below:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      InMotion
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These guys will give you an opportunity to get Web hosting for a price-point of around $3&#8211;6 USD; a great deal.&nbsp; The best part of it, is that they
  have great servers.&nbsp; And, even for the price, they'll provide you with a good customer service experience.&nbsp; It's very important for everyone who is
  running their own Web site to have a good relationship with their Web hosting provider.
</p>
<p>
  I'd recommend you taking a look at the offers from both <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> and
  InMotion; choosing what will work best for you.&nbsp; For this article, I'll show you how you can sign-up with
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> and host a Web site on their Web servers.
</p>
<p>
  The domain name should be chosen wisely.&nbsp; There are 3 key things to keep in mind while selecting a domain name for your Web site:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      The URL of your future Web site is the first thing that the visitor will see.&nbsp; A kick-ass domain name will, definitely, make a great and lasting
      impression.
    </li>
    <li>
      The domain name should be the same as your brand name; or, as close to it as possible anyhow.&nbsp; It will be a huge plus to your brand recognition.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep it simple&hellip;&nbsp; Nobody wants to memorize the domain name.&nbsp; If it's something like &quot;thincrunchpizzafromchicago1259.com&quot;, you're
      going to burn in Hell.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
  How to Get a Domain and Web Hosting
</h3>
<p>
  This is where we stop talking and start doing.&nbsp; I've made a step-by-step guide on how you can start working with
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>.&nbsp; Essentially, it will give you a general knowledge that will
  help you to work with InMotion as well because the process is very similar on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, open the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> Web site.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that they advertise their most popular pricing plan right in the header and they list all of the benefits for you.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Good News
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll get free 24/7 customer service from them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Very Good News
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll get a free domain (.com) for a year!&nbsp; Isn't that great?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Let's click on the &quot;Get Started Now&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that they offer 3 different pricing plans.&nbsp; For you, as a beginner, the Basic plan should work fine.&nbsp; It gives you an opportunity to
  host 1 Web site and gives you 50GB of Web site space/storage.&nbsp; It should cover all of your needs.
</p>
<p>
  Once you click on the &quot;Select&quot; button, under the Basic plan, you'll be redirected to the page where you can select the domain name for your future
  Web site.
</p>
<p>
  You may enter any domain name you want.&nbsp; If it's already been registered by someone else,
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> will let you know; and, even offer some alternative names to work
  with.&nbsp; As an example, I decided to go with &quot;mywebsite.com&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, I knew that such a domain name had already been taken, but the Web
  hosting provider offered me alternatives to consider though.
</p>
<p>
  I decided upon &quot;mywebsitedirectory.com&quot;.&nbsp; That doesn't sound very attractive, but it's just an example.&nbsp; I've already explained to you
  earlier, in a section above, how you should choose the domain name properly.
</p>
<p>
  Now, it's time for you to fill in all of the personal data.&nbsp; Below the account information block, you'll notice the package and payment information
  blocks.&nbsp; That's where you can confirm the plan that you want to go with and select the term.
</p>
<p>
  I shouldn't need to explain how to enter your credit card information, eh?
  &nbsp;<br />

    style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  One of my favourite things about <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> is that they offer to install
  WordPress for your in just a few clicks.&nbsp; You'll not have to worry about moving files and/or folders around via the FTP, they'll do everything for you.
</p>
<p>
  You'll only have to fill-in the general information.&nbsp; Once you've entered all of that information, you're done.&nbsp; Click on the &quot;Install
  WordPress&quot; button and they'll&hellip; install it for you&hellip;&nbsp; What a surprise, eh?
</p>
