<p>
  Do you ever feel like your blog's stuck in quicksand?&nbsp; You're writing a lot of posts.&nbsp; You're promoting them.&nbsp; You're responding to each and
  every commenter as if they were your bestest of friends.
</p>
<p>
  But, it's not working though.&nbsp; The more that you work, the harder that you struggle &#8212; the deeper that you sink.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, it may be a
  little hard to swallow, but you could simply suck at writing.
</p>
<p>
  That's not the only reason why people fail.&nbsp; Some people are just lazy, thinking that it's going to happen, without doing any work.&nbsp; Other people,
  never learn how to promote their posts.&nbsp; Others still, are totally anonymous &#8212; needing to improve their connections, before they can succeed.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are also bloggers who do all of that right, and they're still stuck.&nbsp; They're working their asses off, doing everything imaginable to
  promote their blogs, and they're even networking masters who know everybody &#8212; but, they're still failing.&nbsp; And, it's because they suck at writing.
</p>
<p>
  Think about that for a moment.&nbsp; You build it and they come&hellip;&nbsp; But, it sucks &#8212; they leave.&nbsp; And, another potentially great blog
  bites the dust.
