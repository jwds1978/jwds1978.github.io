<p>
  B2B marketers often omit story-telling.&nbsp; Stories are considered to have a stronger impact on the end-users, rather than companies.
</p>
<p>
  However, aren't those also people representing different brands that you target?&nbsp; At the end of the day, whether you run a B2B and/or B2C campaign,
  you're selling to people &#8212; and, people like stories.
</p>
<p>
  Business owners want to see data that provides them with a clear statement, of the reasons of why, they should deal with a particular company.&nbsp; They want
  to see posts with useful information.&nbsp; However, they're also people who don't always need a narrative to understand that a specific piece of content's
  valuable.
</p>
<p>
  This, is where stories come into play.&nbsp; A good story can capture a user's attention, hold them on the page, and evoke a desire to learn where the story
  goes.&nbsp; That's why, different brands from all over the world, have started using video content and story-telling in both their B2B and B2C marketing
  campaigns &#8212; humanizing their projects, making their data relate to the readers, and revealing in what ways their offerings can transform other
  businesses.
</p>
<p>
  So, is video content or story-telling that useful for your

    business
  </a>?&nbsp;
  Let's try to find an answer to this question while considering several cases for using story-telling within B2B marketing.

    case study
  </a>
  on how the same text delivered to their clients, through a narrative and a story, influenced the way that people reacted to it.&nbsp; What they did first, was
  a publication of an article

<p>
  Next, they e-mailed two versions of this text to their subscribers.&nbsp; In the first version, the text was wrapped-up into a story, where users were taken
  to the primary objective.&nbsp; As per the second version, the text was written straight to the point.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the first version showed a greater public engagement into the post.&nbsp; 300% more readers moved from the beginning, right through, to the end
  of the text &#8212; spending, an average of 5 minutes, longer to read the copy as compared to the straight-forward version.

   The Web saw many companies communicating their services to their audience(s) through stories.&nbsp; Here, are a few of the most remarkable ones&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Norton
</h4>
<p>
  The world leader in digital security, released a 20-minute documentary video, about a small and picturesque Romanian town Râmnicu Vâlcea &#8212; better known,
  as the hacker capital of the world.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

    style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  The video features stories of scammers who'd hacked accounts of the members of the presidential family, Facebook, Google, NASA, the US Army, etc.&nbsp; While
  telling stories of real people, who were imprisoned for hacking companies and organizations of all sizes, Norton transports the audience into the world of
  cyber crimes &#8212; communicating how fragile the Web space is and how important it is to take care of your virtual security.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Salesforce
</h4>
<p>
  Another world-known company, making use of videos, to deliver stories to their consumers.&nbsp; Instead of adding a regular section with user testimonials to
  the homepage of their Web site, they devote a separate page for every client who shares feedback about their services.&nbsp; Most importantly, people tell
  their success stories via videos, which are known as better attention-grabbers and stronger influencers.
</p>
<p>
  Just have a look at the Aston Martin story of using Salesforce to add a personal touch to their business.
