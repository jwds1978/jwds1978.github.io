<p>
  So, you're ready to make a dent in the universe, eh?&nbsp; You have great ideas to share with the world and blogging's how youâ€™re going to get it done.&nbsp;
  Good for you.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there's more to starting a blog than simply having great ideas.&nbsp; However, you've already made an important decision&hellip;&nbsp; You're going
  with <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After all, Internet big-wigs &#8212; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-chris-brogan" rel="me" title="Chris Brogan">Chris Brogan</a>, <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-content-marketing-and-copyright-articles" rel="me" title="Content Marketing and Copyright Articles">Brian Clark</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-marie-forleos-blog-create-a-life-you-love" rel="me" title="Marie Forleo's Blog: Create A Life You Love">Marie
  Forleo</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-michael-hyatt-your-virtual-mentor" rel="me" title="Michael Hyatt | Your Virtual Mentor">Michael
  Hyatt</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-smart-blogger" rel="me" title="Smart Blogger">Jon Morrow</a>, <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-amy-porterfield-online-marketing-expert" rel="me" title="Amy Porterfield | Online Marketing Expert">Amy
  Porterfield</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-problogger-blog-tips-the-blog" rel="me" title="ProBlogger Blog Tips - The Blog">Darren Rowse</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-mari-smith" rel="me" title="Blog">Mari Smith</a>, <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-gary-vaynerchuk" rel="me" title="Blog">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>, etc. &#8212; all use <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, the more that you read, the more that it seems like you'd be a total idiot if you went with anything else.&nbsp; There are hundreds of <a
    href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professional themes</a> to make your blog look absolutely
  stunning.&nbsp; Thousands of clever plugins to add a myriad of different features.&nbsp; And, countless experienced WordPress professionals who can help
  should you find yourself out of your depth.
</p>
<p>
  So, you're certain that it's a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a> blog that you need.&nbsp; But, the big question, is <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-php-mysql-web-hosting-wordpress" rel="me" title="PHP / MySQL Web Hosting :: WordPress">where do you get one</a>?
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="the-seductive-lure-of-wordpresscom">
  The Seductive Lure of WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way to get your own <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a> blog &#8212; hands down &#8212; is to create one for free, over at <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.&nbsp; And, at first, it seems like a no-brainer too.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you're getting WordPress directly from the guys who originally created WordPress.&nbsp; That's got to be good, eh?&nbsp; Secondly, they handle all of
  the behind-the-scenes technical stuff which you really don't want to have to worry about yourself.&nbsp; What a huge relief.&nbsp; And, thirdly, it's
  free!&nbsp; Did I mention that it's free?
</p>
<p>
  But, while it's an undeniably sweet deal for some less serious bloggers, there are a few things that you should know before choosing to <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">host your universe-denting blog</a> at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom"
    rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="think-twice-before-choosing-wordpresscom">
  Think Twice Before Choosing WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  Credit where credit's due&hellip;&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>'s an awesome
  option for some people.&nbsp; It's great for personal blogs, community Web sites, and low-key blogging experiments.
</p>
<p>
  But, the reality is, that to provide a reliable service &#8212; for free &#8212; to a wide-range of people with different needs and skill levels, you have to
  lock things down a bit.&nbsp; You just can't offer fully fledged WordPress to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  So, the flavour of WordPress you get at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>'s kind of
  like a dumbed-down WordPress.&nbsp; It's the blogging equivalent of those safety scissors with rounded tips that they give you as a kid.&nbsp; They don't cut
  so great, but at least no-one's getting hurt.
</p>
<p>
  And, if you want to &quot;un-dumb&quot; it, there's often a cost attached.&nbsp; But hey, the guys at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom"
    rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> need to put food on the table like everyone else.
</p>
<p>
  So that you can start your blogging journey with eyes wide open, here are some surprising restrictions that you should know about <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> before <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-php-mysql-web-hosting-wordpress" rel="me" title="PHP / MySQL Web Hosting :: WordPress">hosting your blog</a> there.
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      You're forced to choose from a limited selection of &quot;approved&quot; themes.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          If you've already been thinking about the design of your blog, you've probably been salivating at the huge selection of <a
            href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professionally designed WordPress themes</a>
          available to you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you had your heart set on one of these, too bad, so sad.&nbsp; You're out of luck.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> doesn't support the vast majority of themes
          available from 3rd-party developers.&nbsp; So, you're just going to have to get the closest match possible from the much smaller selection of themes
          that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> does offer.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          And, while they do allow a few minor modifications to their themes &#8212; changing the background colour, the header, and/or the navigation menu
          &#8212; that's about it.&nbsp; So, your blog will end-up looking like a lot of other blogs out there.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Of course, you could take advantage of the premium theme upgrades that give you a more sophisticated design, but you'll have the same customization
          restrictions as with their free themes though.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Unless you want to spend another $99 USD per year.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> offers a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-custom-design-support-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="Custom Design :: Support :: WordPress.com">Custom Design</a> upgrade that allows you to modify your fonts and to use your own CSS code for
          additional styling.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You can't change your Web site's layout.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          As you grow and evolve, you'll want for your blog to evolve as well.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The problem though, is that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> more than likely
          won't let you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          For example, let's assume that you go with free hosting at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>, and you like everything about the theme that you picked.&nbsp; Except, you're just not too crazy about the
          placement of your social media icons.&nbsp; Perhaps, you want them to appear in your header rather than in the sidebar.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If that's the case, you're kind of stuck.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> doesn't permit you to alter the underlying structure of any of their themes.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Or, perhaps, you've seen a neat little countdown timer on another Web site that would be perfect for your sales page.&nbsp; The only problem, is that
          many custom widgets like that use JavaScript&hellip;&nbsp; JavaScript isn't permitted on your theme at <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Fun timers aren't the only place where JavaScript's useful.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          E-mail opt-in forms from services like <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-email-marketing-aweber" rel="me"
            title="Email Marketing | AWeber">Aweber</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-marketing-automation-sell-more-stuff-mailchimp" rel="me"
            title="Marketing Automation - Sell More Stuff | MailChimp">MailChimp</a> contain JavaScript.&nbsp; Therefore, you can't use them on your blog at <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.&nbsp; Instead, you'd have to link to an
          off-site e-mail opt-in form &#8212; which, may cause your opt-in rates to plummet.
