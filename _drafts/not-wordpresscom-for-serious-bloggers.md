<p>
  So, you're ready to make a dent in the universe, eh?&nbsp; You have great ideas to share with the world and blogging's how youâ€™re going to get it done.&nbsp;
  Good for you.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there's more to starting a blog than simply having great ideas.&nbsp; However, you've already made an important decision&hellip;&nbsp; You're going
  with WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  After all, Internet big-wigs &#8212; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-chris-brogan" rel="me" title="Chris Brogan">Chris Brogan</a>, <a

  Hyatt</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-smart-blogger" rel="me" title="Smart Blogger">Jon Morrow</a>, <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-amy-porterfield-online-marketing-expert" rel="me" title="Amy Porterfield | Online Marketing Expert">Amy

    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-gary-vaynerchuk" rel="me" title="Blog">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>, etc. &#8212; all use WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, the more that you read, the more that it seems like you'd be a total idiot if you went with anything else.&nbsp; There are hundreds of <a
    href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professional themes</a> to make your blog look absolutely
  stunning.&nbsp; Thousands of clever plugins to add a myriad of different features.&nbsp; And, countless experienced WordPress professionals who can help
  should you find yourself out of your depth.
</p>
<p>
  So, you're certain that it's a WordPress blog that you need.&nbsp; But, the big question, is where do you get one?
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="the-seductive-lure-of-wordpresscom">
  The Seductive Lure of WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way to get your own WordPress blog &#8212; hands down &#8212; is to create one for free, over at WordPress.com.&nbsp; And, at first, it seems like
  a no-brainer too.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you're getting WordPress directly from the guys who originally created WordPress.&nbsp; That's got to be good, eh?&nbsp; Secondly, they handle all of
  the behind-the-scenes technical stuff which you really don't want to have to worry about yourself.&nbsp; What a huge relief.&nbsp; And, thirdly, it's
  free!&nbsp; Did I mention that it's free?
</p>
<p>
  But, while it's an undeniably sweet deal for some less serious bloggers, there are a few things that you should know before choosing to host your
  universe-denting blog at WordPress.com.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="think-twice-before-choosing-wordpresscom">
  Think Twice Before Choosing WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  Credit where credit's due&hellip;&nbsp; WordPress.com's an awesome option for some people.&nbsp; It's great for personal blogs, community Web sites, and
  low-key blogging experiments.
</p>
<p>
  But, the reality is, that to provide a reliable service &#8212; for free &#8212; to a wide-range of people with different needs and skill levels, you have to
  lock things down a bit.&nbsp; You just can't offer fully fledged WordPress to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  So, the flavour of WordPress you get at WordPress.com's kind of like a dumbed-down WordPress.&nbsp; It's the blogging equivalent of those safety scissors with
  rounded tips that they give you as a kid.&nbsp; They don't cut so great, but at least no-one's getting hurt.
</p>
<p>
  And, if you want to &quot;un-dumb&quot; it, there's often a cost attached.&nbsp; But hey, the guys at WordPress.com need to put food on the table like
  everyone else.
</p>
<p>
  So that you can start your blogging journey with eyes wide open, here are some surprising restrictions that you should know about WordPress.com before hosting
  your blog there.
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      You're forced to choose from a limited selection of &quot;approved&quot; themes.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          If you've already been thinking about the design of your blog, you've probably been salivating at the huge selection of <a
            href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professionally designed WordPress themes</a>
          available to you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you had your heart set on one of these, too bad, so sad.&nbsp; You're out of luck.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          WordPress.com doesn't support the vast majority of themes available from 3rd-party developers.&nbsp; So, you're just going to have to get the closest
          match possible from the much smaller selection of themes that WordPress.com does offer.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          And, while they do allow a few minor modifications to their themes, such as changing the background colour, the header and/or the navigation menu,
          that's about it.&nbsp; So, your blog will end-up looking like a lot of other blogs out there.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Of course, you could take advantage of the premium theme upgrades &#8212; starting at $50 USD &#8212; that give you a more sophisticated design, but
          you'll have the same customization restrictions as with their free themes.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Unless you want to spend another $99 USD per year.&nbsp; WordPress.com offers a <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-custom-design-support-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="Custom Design :: Support :: WordPress.com">Custom
          Design</a> upgrade that allows you to modify your fonts and to use your own CSS code for additional styling.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You can't change your Web site's layout.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
