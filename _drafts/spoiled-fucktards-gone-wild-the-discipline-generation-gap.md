title: "Spoiled Fucktards Gone Wild: The Discipline/Generation Gap"

<p>
  An ever-increasing lack of authority has bred, as a leading psychologist forewarned, a &quot;spoilt generation&quot; of children who believe that grown-ups
  must earn their respect.&nbsp; Aric Sigman's research shows, the rise of the &quot;little emperor&quot; spans the class divide and is fuelling ills from
  childhood obesity to teenage pregnancy.&nbsp; Attempts to &quot;empower&quot; children, and a lack of discipline in the classroom, have also fostered rising
  levels of violence &#8212; at home, at school, and in the street.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Sigman, a fellow of the
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-royal-society-of-medicine" rel="me" title="The Royal Society of Medicine">Royal Society of Medicine</a>, said
  that nursery-age children are becoming increasingly violent and disrespectful towards their teachers &#8212; &quot;parent battering&quot; is on the rise
  &#8212; and the number of policemen attacked by children is soaring.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Sigman, said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    Authority is a basic health requirement in children's lives.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Children of the spoilt generation are used to having their demands met by their parents and others in authority, and that in-turn, makes them unprepared for
    the realities of adult life.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This has consequences in every area of society, from the classroom to the workplace, the streets to the criminal courts, and rehabilitation clinics.&nbsp;
    Being spoilt is now classless &#8212; from aristocracy to underclass, children are now spoilt in ways that go far beyond materialism.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This is partly the result of an inability to distinguish between being authoritative versus authoritarian, leaving concepts such as authority and boundaries
    blurred.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    And, the consequences are measurable &#8212; Britain now has the highest rates of child depression, child-on-child murder, underage pregnancy, obesity,
    violent and anti-social behaviour and pre-teen alcoholism &#8212; since records began.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  For his report, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation" rel="me" title="The Spoilt Generation">The Spoilt Generation</a>, he drew on
  150 studies and reports, including official figures on crime and data on parenting strategies.&nbsp; Taken together, they showed many of the problems
  blighting &quot;broken Britain&quot; are linked to a lack of discipline.&nbsp; This is being exacerbated by misguided attempts to give children more control
  over their lives.

<p>
  Dr. Sigman says that youngsters' inflated sense of their own importance is fuelling the obesity epidemic.&nbsp; Children feel that they have the right to
  demand foods which would once have been given as an occasional treat.&nbsp; He suggests, that some children thought to have attention deficit hyperactivity
  disorder, might simply have never learned how to behave.&nbsp; Calling for &quot;commonsense policies&quot; to put children in their place, Dr. Sigman said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    There should be an absolute presumption both in law and in policy that adults &quot;know better&quot; and are in the right unless there are exceptional
    reasons.&nbsp; Teachers' authority has been vastly weakened legally, professionally and culturally.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    There should be a presumption that teachers &quot;know better&quot; and are in the right, unless it is shown otherwise.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  He also believes that fathers should have more access to their children following separation and/or divorce.
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    Separated fathers must be legally recognised as being of paramount importance.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  His views were echoed by experts in health and childcare.&nbsp; Michele Elliott, of the children's charity Kidscape, said:
  <blockquote>
    Children no longer have boundaries.&nbsp; It's bad for children and it's bad for parents.&nbsp; Some parents, due to a lack of time, pressures at work and
    so forth, are trying to buy their children's love, which is toxic.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They feel guilty for not being around as often so when their children ask for things they simply say &quot;yes&quot; to compensate.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Professor Cary Cooper, head of psychology and health at Lancaster University, said long working-hours had taken a terrible toll on families.
  <blockquote>
    As a result parents cannot invest the time in their kids that they should.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    With their parents out to work all the time the children are turning to their peer groups to provide them with the family they need.&nbsp; We have been more
    concerned with becoming an affluent, successful country at the expense of investing in our family and our children.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Tim Loughton, Tory children's spokesman, said:
  <blockquote>
    We believe that parents should be taking a greater responsibility for their children and that teachers and other figures in authority should be able to
    exercise their powers when the parameters are broken.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  He said that the Conservatives were devising a National Citizens' Service for all 16-year-olds, giving them the chance to go on a summer challenge &#8212;
  involving outward-bound, team building, and community engagement work.&nbsp; A Department for Children, Schools and Families spokesman said:
  <blockquote>
    It's pathetic to knock a whole generation of young people through sweeping generalisations.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The vast majority of young people play positive roles in their communities, do well at school and are a credit to their families and themselves.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Parents, not politicians, bring up children.&nbsp; We've given police and teachers the tough powers they've asked for to deal with anti-social behaviour,
    criminal activity and poor discipline by the small minority.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    We help parents that need the most support through Family Intervention Partnerships.&nbsp; Standards have never been higher in school and there has been
    massive investment in youth facilities and activities outside the classroom.&nbsp; Teenage conceptions are falling and fewer young people are drinking
    alcohol or taking drugs.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Ministers are clear that this should be the best country in the world for children to live &#8212; but we know there is more to do and have never made any
    bones about it.

  Just the other day, on the news, I saw a report about how everyone's up in arms that our schools are failing our kids.&nbsp; Teacher shortages, lack of
  budgeting, and students not being prepared for higher education &#8212; let alone, the world.&nbsp; But, has it yet dawned on you that we're failing our
  teachers?
</p>
<p>
  Things are very different now than from when I was growing up.&nbsp; We were raised to have manners, be respectful, listen to our teachers, and do the best
  work that we could.&nbsp; We feared the paddle in school and actually had consequences when we got home.&nbsp; Our parents sat down with us and helped us with
  our homework.&nbsp; If there was a problem at school, they went in and talked to the teacher.&nbsp; But, most of all, they raised us to adhere to the Golden
  Rule of conduct.
</p>
<p>
  But, today it's quite different though.&nbsp; Early childhood teachers are expected to raise the children in their care.&nbsp; The way children are treated
  today's detrimental to them and to the teachers in their profession.&nbsp; They're either being spoiled beyond belief or they get absolutely no attention at
  home.&nbsp; Therefore, they feel that they're entitled to everything they want and/or are constantly acting out to get the attention that they crave.&nbsp;
  This, and many other issues, are starting younger and younger.
</p>

<h3 id="not-working-on-potty-training">
  Not Working on Potty Training
</h3>
<p>
  There's nothing more irritating than trying to potty train a child during the week and have it all fail over the weekend.&nbsp; It's a parent's job to work
  with the child at home and in partnership with the teacher during the week.&nbsp; Everyone should be on the same page about how training in each atmosphere
  &#8212; school and home &#8212; will be handled.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="excessive-spoiling">
  Excessive Spoiling
</h3>
<p>
  By doing this, you're teaching your children that they're entitled to everything that they want.&nbsp; Even at a young age, children in this atmosphere are
  whiney, mouthy, and mean spirited.&nbsp; Due to the sphere of influence, they teach other children by their actions, that it's OK to act in such a
  manner&hellip;&nbsp; That it's also OK to act any way they want.&nbsp; By allowing your children to behave in this way, you're failing your child's educators.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="babying-them">
  Babying Them
</h3>
<p>
  I understand that you need to love on your child and do things for them at times.&nbsp; However, when you baby them to the extent that they can't do anything
  for themselves, it makes it hard on teachers in the classroom.&nbsp; I've seen two year olds that don't eat solid foods because they don't know how to
  chew.&nbsp; Their parents don't sit down and work with them.&nbsp; I've seen six and seven year olds who can't tie their shoes and/or button their pants.
</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interest-in-their-learning">
  Lack of Interest in Their Learning
</h3>
<p>
  When I was growing up, my parents worked with me on the things that I was having trouble with.&nbsp; I see five year olds who don't know their shapes,
  numbers, and/or colours.&nbsp; When teachers inform parents of these issues, they get many varied responses&hellip;&nbsp; From total disinterest, to excuses,
  to smirks and laughter.&nbsp; It's as if no one cares.&nbsp; It's not their sole responsibility to teach your child the things that they need to know.&nbsp;
  You need to work with them &#8212; and the teachers &#8212; too.

<h3 id="lack-of-interest-in-their-child-period">
  Lack of Interest in Their Child &#8212; Period
</h3>
<p>
  I see so many parents on cell phones at pick-up time.&nbsp; Between snippets of conversation, they're telling their children to get ready-to-go.&nbsp; This,
  is heartbreaking.&nbsp; You've been apart from them all day and can't spare five minutes to ask them how their day was?&nbsp; Although, this is a small
  example, it explains why some of the children are stuck like glue to the teacher all day.&nbsp; They don't get enough attention at home so they'll do anything
  at school to get attention of any kind.&nbsp; Some kids are glued to them at the hip, while others act-out.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="not-allowing-teachers-to-discipline">
  Not Allowing Teachers to Discipline
</h3>
<p>
  I've come across parents who don't want their children to be put in time-out and/or disciplined.&nbsp; In their eyes, their children are &quot;just
  babies&quot; and don't know right from wrong.&nbsp; This is, regardless, that the children are ages two and five.&nbsp; This request makes handling a
  classroom of sixteen to twenty, especially, difficult.&nbsp; The child knows that there are no consequences at home nor school.&nbsp; So, they'll be defiant
  and get in trouble.&nbsp; This, in-turn, encourages their classmates to act the same way.&nbsp; It also puts a strain on teachers.&nbsp; They spend more time
  managing those who act-out than they do teaching and preparing children to be successful.&nbsp; They're supposed to be teaching them necessary skills.&nbsp;
  The fact that they have to constantly stop what they're doing's a disservice to the children, themselves, and to the future of our society.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  All of these examples and scenarios lead to chaos and great frustration in the classroom.&nbsp; Don't misunderstand, teachers love your children and want to
  see them grow, be happy, and be successful.&nbsp; However, they strongly need for the parents to step-up and support them and the purpose of their job.&nbsp;
  If we all work together, classrooms will run smoother, our children will be happier and ready-to-learn, and we can all thrive.
