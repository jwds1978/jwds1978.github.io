    Everything is negotiable.<br />
    Whether or not the negotiation is easy&hellip; is another thing.<br />
    They always want to reduce the fees, but they never want to reduce the value.

### About the Rate Things
Clients obsessed with nickel and diming are pathological&hellip;&nbsp; Although James is open to negotiation, and his rates are variable depending upon the
individual project(s), there are acceptable ranges for the associated pay rate(s).

James only wants to work with clients who treat him with the professionalism and respect he deserves.&nbsp; If you see him in the same light as your kid
nephew who 'builds websites', then you're setting him up to be screwed over.&nbsp; Trust me &#8212; the only bad clients he's ever worked with were bad from
the start.&nbsp; There was always something unsettling about how their engagement was drafted, and not trusting his gut always led to a nightmare situation
at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour.

James' bandwidth is limited &#8212; he can only work on so many projects at any given time.&nbsp; And, while fear often irrationally leads us to accepting
whatever we can get, its always better to suffer short-term (and, do a little more lead generation and cultivation) instead of working long-term with a
toxic client.

If the math doesn't work out with what you want to do and the budget you have to do it&hellip; do less.
