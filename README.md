All of my commits throughout GitHub will be signed. My key can be found at Keybase.

Although GitHub allows for Git to sign commits and have them displayed as such, I'm not aware of an Android client that supports it. Therefore, I will manually sign my commit messages.

My signed messages can be verified at Keybase.
