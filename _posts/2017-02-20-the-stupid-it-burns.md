<p>
  There are some really ignorant fucktards working at
  <a href="http://www.themission.ca" rel="external" target="_blank" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Elgin Street Mission</a>.&nbsp;
  I have a zero-tolerance for stupid&hellip;&nbsp; It took a lot for me to not beat the stupid out of some shitbag staff tonight.&nbsp; We'll call him Pip
  Koch-weser.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  A friend of mine, who we'll call Heath Pincus, gave me his cookies while we were standing in line for coffee tonight.&nbsp; Pip was serving coffee.
</p>
<p>
  After Heath gave me his cookies, Pip told me that I had to give them to him and/or give them to somebody else.&nbsp; Excuse me?!?&nbsp; Who the fuck is Pip to
  tell anybody that they can't give their friend their food; or, anything else, for that matter?
</p>
<p>
  Needless to say, I refused to give Pip *my* cookies.&nbsp; He then proceeds to tell me that I have to either give the cookies to him, somebody else, or leave
  the premise without eating.&nbsp; At this point, I'm getting perturbed; to say the least.&nbsp; When I again refuse, he tries to physically take them from
  me.&nbsp; Now, I'm extremely fucking pissed off.&nbsp; I gave him one verbal warning to not come within arm's length of me, showing any sign of agression
  whatsoever, again; I'd not be the one getting hurt.
</p>
<p>
  Seriously; like, WTF?!?&nbsp; I walk away from Pip, before things escalate further with him, to seek out the 'captain' for the evening.&nbsp; We'll call him
  Ric Chackel.
</p>
<p>
  I tell Ric what happened and asked him what he's going to do about it.&nbsp; His response, is for me to just 'let it go'.&nbsp; By this time, that just pissed
  me right the fuck off&hellip;&nbsp; If I weren't upset before, I most definitely was now.
</p>
<p>
  Fuck this fucking shit.&nbsp; I don't know WTF is going on around there, but this comes on the heels of
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/2017/02/16/accessibility-at-the-elgin-street-mission" rel="me" title="Accessibility at The Elgin Street Mission">
    what happened the other day
  </a>.&nbsp;
  That place needs to unfuck itself right fucking swift-like.
</p>
