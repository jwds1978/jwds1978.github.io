<p>
  So, you're ready to make a dent in the universe, eh?&nbsp; You have great ideas to share with the world and blogging's how you’re going to get it done.&nbsp;
  Good for you.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there's more to starting a blog than simply having great ideas.&nbsp; However, you've already made an important decision&hellip;&nbsp; You're going
  with <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a>.
</p>

    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a>.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  In fact, the more that you read, the more that it seems like you'd be a total idiot if you went with anything else.&nbsp; There are hundreds of <a
    href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professional themes</a> to make your blog look absolutely
  stunning.&nbsp; Thousands of clever plugins to add a myriad of different features.&nbsp; And, countless <a href="{{ site.url }}/freelance/#services" rel="me"
    title="Freelance :: James W.D. Stewart">experienced WordPress professional</a>s who can help should you find yourself out of your depth.
</p>
<p>
  So, you're certain that it's a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a> blog that you need.&nbsp; But, the big question, is <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-php-mysql-web-hosting-wordpress" rel="me" title="PHP / MySQL Web Hosting :: WordPress">where do you get one</a>?
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="the-seductive-lure-of-wordpresscom">
  The Seductive Lure of WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way to get your own <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a> blog &#8212; hands down &#8212; is to create one for free, over at <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.&nbsp; And, at first, it seems like a no-brainer too.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you're getting WordPress directly from the guys who originally created WordPress.&nbsp; That's got to be good, eh?&nbsp; Secondly, they handle all of
  the behind-the-scenes technical stuff which you really don't want to have to worry about yourself.&nbsp; What a huge relief.&nbsp; And, thirdly, it's
  free!&nbsp; Did I mention that it's free?
</p>
<p>
  But, while it's an undeniably sweet deal for some less serious bloggers, there are a few things that you should know before choosing to <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">host your universe-denting blog</a> at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom"
    rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="think-twice-before-choosing-wordpresscom">
  Think Twice Before Choosing WordPress.com
</h3>
<p>
  Credit where credit's due&hellip;&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>'s an awesome
  option for some people.&nbsp; It's great for personal blogs, community Web sites, and low-key blogging experiments.
</p>
<p>
  But, the reality is, that to provide a reliable service &#8212; for free &#8212; to a wide-range of people with different needs and skill levels, you have to
  lock things down a bit.&nbsp; You just can't offer fully fledged WordPress to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  So, the flavour of WordPress you get at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>'s kind of
  like a dumbed-down WordPress.&nbsp; It's the blogging equivalent of those safety scissors with rounded tips that they give you as a kid.&nbsp; They don't cut
  so great, but at least no-one's getting hurt.
</p>
<p>
  And, if you want to &quot;un-dumb&quot; it, there's often a cost attached.&nbsp; But hey, the guys at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom"
    rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> need to put food on the table like everyone else.
</p>
<p>
  So that you can start your blogging journey with eyes wide open, here are some surprising restrictions that you should know about <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> before <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-php-mysql-web-hosting-wordpress" rel="me" title="PHP / MySQL Web Hosting :: WordPress">hosting your blog</a> there.
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      You're forced to choose from a limited selection of &quot;approved&quot; themes.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          If you've already been thinking about the design of your blog, you've probably been salivating at the huge selection of <a
            href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">professionally designed WordPress themes</a>
          available to you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you had your heart set on one of these, too bad, so sad.&nbsp; You're out of luck.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> doesn't support the vast majority of themes
          available from 3rd-party developers.&nbsp; So, you're just going to have to get the closest match possible from the much smaller selection of themes
          that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> does offer.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          And, while they do allow a few minor modifications to their themes &#8212; changing the background colour, the header, and/or the navigation menu
          &#8212; that's about it.&nbsp; So, your blog will end-up looking like a lot of other blogs out there.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Of course, you could take advantage of the premium theme upgrades that give you a more sophisticated design, but you'll have the same customization
          restrictions as with their free themes though.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Unless you want to spend another $99 USD per year.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> offers a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-custom-design-support-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="Custom Design :: Support :: WordPress.com">Custom Design</a> upgrade that allows you to modify your fonts and to use your own CSS code for
          additional styling.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You can't change your Web site's layout.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          As you grow and evolve, you'll want for your blog to evolve as well.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The problem though, is that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> more than likely
          won't let you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          For example, let's assume that you go with free hosting at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>, and you like everything about the theme that you picked.&nbsp; Except, you're just not too crazy about the
          placement of your social media icons.&nbsp; Perhaps, you want them to appear in your header rather than in the sidebar.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If that's the case, you're kind of stuck.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
            title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> doesn't permit you to alter the underlying structure of any of their themes.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Or, perhaps, you've seen a neat little countdown timer on another Web site that would be perfect for your sales page.&nbsp; The only problem, is that
          many custom widgets like that use JavaScript&hellip;&nbsp; JavaScript isn't permitted on your theme at <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Fun timers aren't the only place where JavaScript's useful.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          E-mail opt-in forms from services like <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-email-marketing-aweber" rel="me"
            title="Email Marketing | AWeber">Aweber</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-marketing-automation-sell-more-stuff-mailchimp" rel="me"
            title="Marketing Automation - Sell More Stuff | MailChimp">MailChimp</a> contain JavaScript.&nbsp; Therefore, you can't use them on your blog at <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.&nbsp; Instead, you'd have to link to an
          off-site e-mail opt-in form &#8212; which, may cause your opt-in rates to plummet.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You'll have to pay for various &quot;optional&quot; extras.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Although <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> allows you to get started for free,
          it's a profit-making business &#8212; deep down, they're hoping that you'll soon outgrow the limited functionality of your free blog, and upgrade to
          some of their paid features.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          I've already mentioned premium themes, but here are some other paid upgrades that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
          title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> offers:
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Don't want 3rd-party advertisements appearing on your blog?</span>
              <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>
                  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> reserves the right to display ads on
                  your Web site.&nbsp; But, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-no-ads-support-wordpresscom" rel="me"

          Web-based e-mail providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. are fine for your personal e-mails.&nbsp; But, for your professional e-mail communication,

          Unfortunately, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> doesn't offer e-mail hosting

          As stated on <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>, the exception would be if you

            <li>
              They could disable your links.

      You're banned from using custom plugins.

          A plugin is a software module that you <a

          functionality.&nbsp; No knowledge of coding is necessary to install and use a plugin &#8212; it simply takes a few clicks.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          You can get plugins to help you with SEO, plugins for backing up your blog, plugins for creating custom forms, plugins to improve the speed of your
          blog, plugins to create membership sites, etc.&nbsp; The list is huge.&nbsp; At the last check, the number of <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpress-plugins-plugins-extend-and-expand-the-functionality-of-wordpress" rel="me"
            title="WordPress Plugins :: Plugins extend and expand the functionality of WordPress">WordPress plugins</a> available from independent developers is
          27,000 and counting.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          But, for security reasons, you're not permitted to use any 3rd-party plugins when you host your Web site on <a
            href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The ability to use custom plugins, for added functionality, is one of the great strengths of <a

            title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">WordPress</a>.&nbsp; Essentially, without custom plugins, you've effectively crippled
          it.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          However, you do have the option of upgrading to <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"

      Your blog could be shut-down at any given time.

          without notice, effective immediately&quot;.&nbsp; You may think that you run a squeaky-clean blog and that you'd never come close to a ToS violation,
          but do you really want to give someone that much control over your livelihood?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Mistakes get made&hellip;&nbsp; Accidents happen&hellip;&nbsp; And, your blog could get shut-down as a result.&nbsp; Fair or not, it's part of the
          agreement when you host your site on <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          For most serious bloggers, the possibility of an unintentional ToS violation &#8212; however remote &#8212; and sudden shut-down is reason enough to
          look elsewhere.&nbsp; Why leave the door open even just a crack?&nbsp; It's just not worth it.

<p>
  While <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> certainly makes it easy to get a WordPress
  blog up-and-running, you have to ask yourself if you can put up with the compromises that come along with it.
</p>
<p>
  It's like having a brand new Ferrari and being told that you can only drive it 30 km/h.&nbsp; And, only on weekends.
</p>
<p>
  But, fortunately, there's an alternative&hellip;&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">Self-hosted WordPress</a>.&nbsp; It's not as scary as some people would have you believe.

  What the Hell's &quot;Self-Hosted&quot; WordPress
</h3>
<p>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-blog-tool-publishing-platform-and-cms-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">Self-hosted WordPress</a>, simply means that you install the free WordPress software on your
  own Web server, rather than having <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> host your blog
  for you.
</p>
<p>
  When I say your own Web server, I'm not talking about buying some super-computer and hiding it away in your garage.&nbsp; I'm simply talking about buying Web
  hosting services from one of the hundreds of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-php-mysql-web-hosting-wordpress" rel="me"
    title="PHP / MySQL Web Hosting :: WordPress">reputable Web hosts</a> out there.
</p>
<p>
  So, don't freak out if you're not a techie.&nbsp; It's really not that hard to self-host.
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of tutorials on the Web to assist you with self-hosting your blog.&nbsp; And, if you ever encounter an obstacle, there are plenty of
  affordable <a href="{{ site.url }}/freelance/#services" rel="me" title="Freelance :: James W.D. Stewart">WordPress specialist</a>s available online.
</p>
<p>
  To self-host your blog, all that you need to do, is to get a Web hosting account from a company such as <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-best-web-hosting-fast-professional-website-hosting-services-bluehost" rel="me"
    title="The Best Web Hosting | Fast Professional Website Hosting Services - Bluehost">Bluehost</a>, which costs less than $3 USD per month.
</p>
<p>
  Because WordPress is so popular, many Web hosts (i.e. <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-best-web-hosting-fast-professional-website-hosting-services-bluehost" rel="me"
    title="The Best Web Hosting | Fast Professional Website Hosting Services - Bluehost">Bluehost</a>) have pre-configured &quot;1-click installs&quot; that
  enable you to install WordPress on your Web server within 10 minutes or less.

  If all that you want is a place to express yourself on the Web, then a free blog at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-wordpresscom" rel="me"
    title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>'s more than likely just fine.
</p>
<p>
  But, if your goal is to be taken seriously as a blogger and eventually make money with your blog, you're going to need free-rein to do whatever you want with
  your blog.&nbsp; That means having the ability to change the Web page layout, add custom plugins, and/or install e-mail opt-in boxes on your Web site.&nbsp;
  And, the only way that you're going to accomplish these things, is by self-hosting your blog.
</p>
<p>
  But, don't just take my word for it though.&nbsp; WordPress founder, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-now" rel="me"

    title="Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS :: WordPress">self-hosted WordPress</a> blog like this:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-now">
    Hosting your site on WordPress.com is like renting an apartment, as opposed to a self-hosted WordPress blog that you own outright.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    With a self-hosted WordPress blog, you can do anything you want.&nbsp; Knock down walls.&nbsp; Redecorate it any way you want.&nbsp; But you're responsible
    for the upkeep (i.e. security update, backups, feature upgrades) as well.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Whereas with WordPress.com everything is done for you.&nbsp; But you lose some control.&nbsp; Can't have a yard.&nbsp; Can't tear down walls, etc.

<h3 id="the-bottom-line">
  The Bottom Line
</h3>
<p>
  If you're serious about blogging, you're going to need to have the freedom and control to do whatever you want, however you want, without worrying that you'll
  suddenly hit a brick wall and/or that the rug might someday be arbitrarily pulled-out from beneath you.
</p>
<p>
  The only way to ensure that, is to self-host your WordPress blog.&nbsp; So, that's another decision made.&nbsp; Time to get on with making that dent in the
  universe.
