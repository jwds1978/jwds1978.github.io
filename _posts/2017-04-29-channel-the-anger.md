<p>
  We're human &#8212; every single one of us.&nbsp; We feel happy, and sometimes, we feel smart.&nbsp; Other times, we feel stupid.&nbsp; We enjoy feeling
  loved.&nbsp; We cringe when we feel hated.&nbsp; For sure, we all get angry.&nbsp; Some handle it better than others.&nbsp; At times, in my life, I've been
  somewhat quick to anger.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my entire career, I've been told that I should never get angry.&nbsp; I've been advised that it's a negative emotion that shouldn't enter the
  workplace.&nbsp; However, when I look back at my biggest wins, my most impressive accomplishments have all started with the same common
  denominator&hellip;&nbsp; I'd gotten angry.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  I didn't let it control me.&nbsp; I felt it.&nbsp; I tried to identify what it was that had pushed my buttons &#8212; I went about solving that conflicting
  emotion.&nbsp; I find that getting angry &#8212; in a controlled sense &#8212; has helped me.&nbsp; I think that it may help you as well.
</p>
<p>
  I don't mean for you to get aggressive.&nbsp; If you get too hot, you lose focus.&nbsp; Think of Sonny Corleone in the Godfather.<br />

  Peak performance, for me, is controlled anger and/or determination&hellip;&nbsp; The, proverbial, chip on your shoulder.&nbsp; Look at that chip.&nbsp;
  Understand why it's there &#8212; what is it that has you so irked?&nbsp; Spend time on that feeling&hellip;&nbsp; Let it fuel you &#8212; feel it within your
  bones.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Did someone steal your idea?&nbsp; Get angry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you feel like you aren't in the right industry?&nbsp; Get angry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Not making enough money?&nbsp; Get angry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Were you fired?&nbsp; Get angry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Were you passed over for a promotion?&nbsp; Get angry.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now that you're angry, focus yourself on removing what's made you angry.&nbsp; If you're angry due to getting fired, refocus on your job search, with a fervor
  that you've never brought to a job search before.&nbsp; Use the anger to fuel your energy level.&nbsp; Be more prepared than anyone, so that they can't
  pass-over you for that promotion the next time.
</p>
<p>
  There have been studies where angry college students did better on exams.&nbsp; Military officers are taught to create anger architecture, harnessing the
  energy which they create, when angered.&nbsp; Getting angry, in a controlled and focused way, is used in business negotiations to intimidate.&nbsp; Angry
  negotiators are more optimistic about said negotiation, and more often, get what they want.&nbsp; Anger's about removing obstacles that are in your way.
</p>
<p>
  When anger transforms into fear, and anxiety, you shut down.
</p>
<p>
  The key, is shifting to a forward-leaning anger-based posture in your life and business &#8212; allowing you to act and take informed risks.&nbsp; Desire's no
  longer restrained.&nbsp; It's misleading to think that anger will cloud your judgment&hellip;&nbsp; Anger narrows your focus.&nbsp; Anger can lead to
  meaningful action and result in conflict resolution.
</p>
<p>
  Dig deep &#8212; discover what's holding you back &#8212; get angry and go about changing it.
</p>
<p>
  I'm, by no means, encouraging you to get into a fist-fight and/or bully someone.&nbsp; I want you to find the fire within your belly &#8212; so, you may
  execute goal-directed behaviour.&nbsp; Use the anger to push yourself harder.
</p>
<p>
  Use your anger to get out of bed earlier, and work the extra &frac12;-hour a day.&nbsp; Or, use it to contact that last lead.&nbsp; To follow-up, improve,
  and/or refocus yourself.&nbsp; To evolve, grow, inspire, and/or push.
