  Offhand, I don't know when blogging really became well-known throughout the Internet, but I do know that I started to blog once I created my <a
    href="{{ site.url }}" rel="me" title="">Web site</a> though.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me about adding a blog to my Web site &#8212; gaining the attention
  of many bloggers.&nbsp; It was a great idea as now I have the opportunity to first-hand speak to many veterans through my blog, without having to leave my
  home.
</p>
<p>
  Once I started <a href="{{ site.uri.blog }}" rel="me" title="">my own blog</a>, and began reading up on what it takes to blog, I soon realized that there are
  a lot of military members from around the globe who also blog themselves.&nbsp; Never would I have thought that I'd take to blogging, but here I am.&nbsp;
  Mil-blogging, like homecoming, is a journey &#8212; not a destination.&nbsp; My newspaper and magazine buddies make jokes about how all bloggers must write
  while wearing pajamas&hellip;&nbsp; I'm, simply, happy that they think I'm even wearing pants nowadays.
</p>

  Imagine some of the soldiers, who survived the Battle of Gettysburg, stopping the next day to write their dramatic tales &#8212; and, people from around the
  world, instantly, reading them.&nbsp; If that battle had been fought today, no imagination would be necessary.&nbsp; The military has sought to take action
  towards blogs, as many blogs are posting a lot of images that the military says could be a threat to their military tactics.
</p>
<p>
  With that said, I've learned that blogging has created a new world for many.&nbsp; A world where many can go to get away from the images of the battle field,
  find other people in the service dealing with the same issues, a place to express their thoughts and feelings, and a place where people can keep in touch and
  make new friends.&nbsp; Defence community members (i.e. moms, soldiers in the field, veterans, wives, etc.) are jumping onto the blog bandwagon and helping
  the overall veteran community on a whole new level.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;

<p>
  The first wave (2001 &#8211; 2007) of mil-blogging was defined and dominated by first-person (i.e. boots-on-the-ground) narratives, unmediated by news
  editors, broadcasts, and/or publications.&nbsp; Some of these, such as Matt Gallagher's blog, later grew into larger, book-length works:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/0306819678" rel="me" title="">Kaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage Little War</a> by Matt Gallagher
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  There are also published collections of mil-blogs.&nbsp; Such as:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/0740769456" rel="me" title="">Doonesbury.com's The Sandbox: Dispatches from Troops in Iraq and Afghanistan</a> by
      G. B. Trudeau
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/0743294181" rel="me" title="">The Blog of War: Front-Line Dispatches from Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan</a> by
      Matthew Currier Burden
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The alchemy of blogs-into-books is important, because technologies change &#8212; print stays.&nbsp; The popularity and influence of mil-blogging culminated
  some time after 2007.&nbsp; One favourite anecdote from the Internet trenches&hellip;&nbsp; In 2007, President George W. Bush met with a group of mil-bloggers
  for a hour-long chat in the Roosevelt Room.&nbsp; Here's a useful report from that event, written by John Donovan:
  <blockquote>
    The President acknowledged, so to speak, the rise of the blogosphere &#8212; which he seems to see as complementary to the [Main Stream Media], a view to
    which I subscribe, as well.&nbsp; We're another vector that people can use to disseminate or gather information &#8212; whether the MSM is gate-guarding it
    because of their biases, or simple economics.&nbsp; There are only so many air minutes, so many column inches, and the MSM is a business.&nbsp; They have to
    make editorial decisions.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    If anything, the blogs hearken back, really, to an earlier time in the growth of the Republic.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    We're the
    &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadside_(printing)" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="Broadside (printing)">broadsides</a>&quot;
    of this era.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The second wave (2007 &#8211; 2014) of mil-blogging happened as blogging platforms became more ubiquitous and easier to use.&nbsp; More people deployed and/or
  had family members deploy.&nbsp; More people started writing and sharing their experiences.&nbsp; At the same time, others had returned from one or more
  deployment experiences, and sought to put those experiences into more context.&nbsp; Without the content of more-immediate experience, many turned to new
  analysis, opinion, and/or advocacy.&nbsp; To paraphrase one mil-blogger of the time:
  <blockquote>
    Some of us went political.&nbsp; And, some of us, went bat-shit crazy.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Blogging was cool&hellip;&nbsp; Everybody was doing it.&nbsp; However, in the later years of this period, mil-blogging began to decline &#8212; as did all
  blogging.&nbsp; That's because Facebook happened&hellip;&nbsp; Tumblr happened&hellip;&nbsp; Twitter happened&hellip;&nbsp; Tablets and small-screens
  happened.&nbsp; Blogging turned into yesterday's news.&nbsp; However, mil-blogging isn't dead &#8212; at least, no more than journalism is.&nbsp; It may be
  evolving, we might not recognize it, but it as sure as Hell ain't dead yet though.
</p>
<p>
  The third wave of mil-blogging?&nbsp; You're soaking in it.&nbsp; The third wave (2014 &#8211; Present) of mil-blogging is being driven by new blogging
  platforms, which de-emphasize comments sections &#8212; once the engines of blog-traffic and engagement &#8212; and, focus on providing to readers a
  professional-looking (although, somewhat generic) and tablet-friendly visual experience.&nbsp; The focus is back, on words and content, and reasoned
  argument.&nbsp; Authors are often policy analysts, strategists, and/or other communicators.
</p>
<p>
  As I've observed, &quot;journaling&quot; and &quot;journalism&quot; share root words.&nbsp; It's all about documenting events, making informed arguments, and
  sharing stories.&nbsp; Using that definition, I was blogging before there was an Internet.&nbsp; And, I'll be blogging long after the Internet is put-up onto
  cinder blocks, as the media and technology change.
</p>
<p>
  The writing is the thing.&nbsp; With humour&hellip;&nbsp; With argument&hellip;&nbsp; With news-you-can-use&hellip;&nbsp; Even, with poetry.&nbsp; At some
  level, it doesn't matter what you're writing, only that you're engaged in the conversation.&nbsp; That's particularly important as we try to stitch together
  what the last two wars have meant to our countries and their militaries &#8212; and, how we move-out smartly from here.&nbsp; Every type of writing &#8212;
  literary, genre, professional, academic, journalistic &#8212; is an opportunity to bridge the civil-military divide.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, a group of movers, shooters, and communicators established an on-line confederation called <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-military-writers-guild" rel="me" title="The Military Writers Guild">The Military Writers Guild</a>.&nbsp; I'm
  pleased to find that it seems to be a mix of young turks and salty dogs.&nbsp; There are digital immigrants and digital natives.&nbsp; There are soldiers and
  sailors and fellow travelers &#8212; and all of them, naturally, are story-tellers.
</p>
<p>
  The mil-blog isn't dead &#8212; long live the mil-blog &#8212; and, keep writing!
