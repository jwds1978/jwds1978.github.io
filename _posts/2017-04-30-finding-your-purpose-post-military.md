<p>
  So much of life after the military is an identity crisis.&nbsp; Yes, there's the emotional, mental, and/or physical pain&hellip;&nbsp; The nightmares, rage,
  and/or insomnia&hellip;&nbsp; The grief, the edginess, and/or the isolation&hellip;&nbsp; Forced smiles, numbness, and/or lack of connection.&nbsp; But,
  underneath all of it though, there's something else.&nbsp; There are questions &#8212; &quot;why am I still here&quot; and &quot;who am I now&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Underneath all of them, is a fear that you no longer have purpose.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  There are two levels to purpose:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Surface:</span>&nbsp; The kind of purpose that comes from what you do &#8212; your activities, job, responsibilities,
      etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Deeper:</span>&nbsp; The kind that comes from who you are &#8212; your personal values, the primary energy from which
      you operate, etc.&nbsp; For life to feel right, a good portion of what you do, should be determined by who you are.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  When you separate from the military, you get hit with changes to both of them.&nbsp; And, unlike most civilian jobs, for warfighters, what you do and who you
  are, are often the same.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="nothing-equals-combats-sense-of-purpose">
  Nothing Equals Combat's Sense of Purpose
</h3>
<p>
  I don't think that I need to explain to you why nothing feels as gratifying, important, and/or as meaningful as combat.&nbsp; How you were trained and bonded,
  to move as one with your team, how that trust runs so deep &#8212; it simply can't be compared to anything within the civilian world.&nbsp; How cohesiveness
  and unity created your sense of identity and purpose.&nbsp; And, how the risk to your lives sealed it.
</p>
<p>
  So, let me just make this clear right now &#8212; there's a no more engaging sense of purpose, than that of protecting and defending each other's lives, in
  combat&hellip;&nbsp; Or, of suffering together &#8212; not because someone forced it upon you, but because you stepped-up to walk among the chosen few.&nbsp;
  You'll not find anything within the civilian world that will equal such a feeling.
</p>
<p>
  You can stop looking for it&hellip;&nbsp; It's nowhere to be found.<br />

<h3 id="lost-within-a-civilian-no-mans-land">
  Lost Within a Civilian No-Man's-Land
</h3>
<p>
  You get out of the military and your whole life spreads-out before you&hellip;&nbsp; Wide-open.&nbsp; You don't know what you want to do, and you don't know
  what you should be doing.&nbsp; There's no one now to define what the shape of your days and/or nights looks like.&nbsp; And, no threat to your existence that
  makes the future seem irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
  You're stranded out here, with no clue what to do, in this civilian world.&nbsp; You don't want to be a civilian &#8212; you'll never be one of them, don't
  worry &#8212; but, you do have to live among them, and find some way to make a life therein.
</p>
<p>
  No, you can't go back &#8212; but, you don't know how to go forward &#8212; all that you long for, is what you'd left behind.&nbsp; Every civilian that you
  know assumes that you're relieved and happy to be done with the military.&nbsp; They don't stop to think that you're like a pro athlete who, at the height of
  his career, gets injured and will never play again.&nbsp; You don't just face career choices, you face a void of purpose.&nbsp; It's not that you just lost
  your job, it's that you lost your whole identity.&nbsp; But, even more importantly, you lost something that very few people will ever experience &#8212; what
  it is to be fully and deeply alive.
</p>
<p>
  This isn't about finding the right job and/or career path and/or hoping it will fulfill you.&nbsp; This is about the &quot;who you are&quot; side of
  purpose.&nbsp; And, it's spiritual &#8212; you're an eternal spirit, having an Earthly experience.&nbsp; Until you solve the &quot;who you are&quot; side,
  nothing that you do will feel like purpose.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="the-hidden-purpose-every-warfighter-forgets">
  The Hidden Purpose Every Warfighter Forgets
</h3>
<p>
  Humanity looks to religion and meditation to find enlightenment of the soul.&nbsp; Well, guess what?.&nbsp; Nobody knows spiritual enlightenment like a
  warfighter does.
</p>
<p>
  And, do you know what else?&nbsp; You aren't just missing your team and your war, you're missing feeling spiritually alive&hellip;&nbsp; Present&hellip;&nbsp;
  In the now&hellip;&nbsp; Surrendered to life and death, content to live now, and to live fully.&nbsp; There's no future to worry about, when death's trying to
  send you home early.&nbsp; There's no past to regret, when your buddy's taking fire and you're in a position to save him.&nbsp; There's only now&hellip;&nbsp;
  And, it's beautiful, colourful, and permeated with a heightened awareness and simplicity.
</p>
<p>
  But, that feeling vanishes when you come home &#8212; before you know it, you're reduced to bitching that civilians don't have a fucking clue what life's all
  about.
</p>
<p>
  Do you know why warfighters hate civilians?&nbsp; It's not just that civilians have no clue about &quot;the real world&quot; &#8212; it's that they're
  unenlightened.&nbsp; They spend their lives worrying over stupid shit that wouldn't begin to phase you.&nbsp; Their lives seem to have so little meaning
  &#8212; they seem to waste them.&nbsp; It grates on your soul as you know, exactly, how precious and fragile life is.&nbsp; And, they don't give a shit what
  you know.&nbsp; So, you bitch about them, and feel some sense of camaraderie in knowing that your fellow warfighters also hate civilians.&nbsp; It gives you
  something to rally around.&nbsp; A place to funnel the hate that you once would've directed toward your enemy.&nbsp; What it really does, is distract you from
  what would be time better spent figuring out how to take your enlightenment, and use it to do something productive and/or meaningful.
</p>
<p>
  Just because you no longer wear a uniform, doesn't mean that your obligation to live with honour and do something important is over.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="all-youll-ever-need-to-be-happy-and-have-purpose-you-possess-right-now">
  All You'll Ever Need to be Happy and Have Purpose, You Possess, Right Now
</h3>
<p>
  So, what are you supposed to do?&nbsp; Or, more accurately, what do most of you do?&nbsp; Whine, mope, bitch, lash-out at everyone around you because they
  don't understand you and you aren't all that happy to be in these circumstances.&nbsp; You think that you're special &#8212; and, you are special &#8212; but,
  you sure as Hell aren't acting like warfighters who were taught values.&nbsp; You're not very likable this way, are you?&nbsp; Yes, you say that you don't
  give a fuck what anyone thinks, but the reality is, you do.&nbsp; It hurts to be left-out, to not belong, to be drowning inside, to lose your relationships,
  your marriage, and/or your family.&nbsp; And, your attitude just drives you deeper into the darkness&hellip;&nbsp; Alone.&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; It's time
  to man-the-fuck-up and live for something greater than yourself.&nbsp; Yes, your life sucks right now&hellip;&nbsp; Yes, you're in a lot of pain&hellip;&nbsp;
  Yes, you have open wounds that burn like Hell when anything gets too close&hellip;&nbsp; Yes, you don't belong.&nbsp; I get it &#8212; I do.&nbsp; I ache for
  you and am here for you, to help you fight your way out of this.&nbsp; But, I'm fucking tired of seeing incredibly good, strong, powerful people who know more
  than most, how beautiful life is &#8212; and, are still blessed to be breathing &#8212; act as if they're powerless, choosing to commit suicide instead of
  being willing to do anything to find well-being, acting as if they got dealt a bad hand, and/or as if they didn't sign-up and step-up to be one of the chosen
  few.&nbsp; You're better than this.
</p>
<p>
  It's about time that you remembered who you are&hellip;&nbsp; Men and women of courage&hellip;&nbsp; Strong&hellip;&nbsp; Capable of enduring what most people
  can't and/or won't&hellip;&nbsp; Men and women who own their power, know their limits, and know that you don't fight alone &#8212; you move, and win, as a
  team.&nbsp; You don't endanger a teammate's life by keeping your mouth shut if you're low on resources.&nbsp; You put the well-being of your team first, and
  part of that means making sure that you're well and supported.&nbsp; If you're fighting this post-military battle on your own right now, you're endangering a
  brother/sister.&nbsp; You need to un-fuck that shit &#8212; reach-out and rely on the support available to you.&nbsp; Stop believing the lie that you're not
  capable of healing and rebuilding a life that feels good.&nbsp; No, you don't let someone defeat you.&nbsp; You own this fight&hellip;&nbsp; As a team.&nbsp;
  This, is who you are.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="you-have-the-power-to-be-significant">
  You Have the Power to be Significant
</h3>
<p>
  Right now &#8212; in this moment.&nbsp; You don't need the VAC to tell you what you can and/or can't do.&nbsp; You don't need someone else to assign you your
  role.&nbsp; You don't need permission to change your life for the better.
</p>
<p>
  All that you need to do, is to remember that you &#8212; and, only you &#8212; can choose your attitude.&nbsp; That's where your power is.&nbsp; That's where
  it's always been.&nbsp; From the day that you enlisted &#8212; and, every damn day since.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="step-up-and-matter">
  Step-Up and Matter
</h3>
<p>
  I look out, at so many warfighters that I love so deeply, and you know what I see?&nbsp; I see how beautiful our scars are.&nbsp; Scars that are earned
  &#8212; not by surrendering to what's easy, but by refusing to give-up when it hurt.&nbsp; I see men and women who've lived through combat and are still
  here.&nbsp; I see men and women who want to be significant again.&nbsp; We have what, only the chosen few, possess&hellip;&nbsp; And, we need you to do more
  than lead small, me-centered lives.&nbsp; We need your leadership in how to live with courage.&nbsp; Leadership in how to be mentally strong.&nbsp; Leadership
  in how to live each day as if it fucking matters&hellip;&nbsp; Because it does fucking matter.
</p>
<p>
  You want to know your purpose?&nbsp; There's only one purpose for human life.&nbsp; And, that purpose is to love &#8212; that's it.&nbsp; That's the magic key
  to the rest of your life&hellip;&nbsp; Loving others.&nbsp; Not the &quot;no one loves me, so I can't love anyone&quot; kind of love &#8212; Hell, no.
</p>
<p>
  You're here, to love with a power and depth, that comes from being enlightened.&nbsp; You're here, to love others, even if it requires sacrifice.&nbsp; You're
  here, to love, because that's how you create a life which matters.&nbsp; And, I'm not talking about romantic love either.&nbsp; I'm talking about the kind of
  love that, has you seeing the people around you as human beings who for the most part, are scared of truly living and/or fear that they're inadequate.&nbsp;
  The kind of love, that has you leaving a generous tip to a taxi driver &#8212; not because he &quot;deserves it&quot;, but because his life might be a bit harder than
  yours.&nbsp; The kind of love, that has you asking how your annoying coworker's weekend went &#8212; not because she's nice to you, but because she's going
  through a divorce, and it's tough.
</p>
<p>
  Sacrificial love, that demands all you have.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why should you sacrifice more?&nbsp; Because, you know what love is.&nbsp; And, you're capable
  of more.&nbsp; If you want to argue that a warfighter's purpose is to kill and hate, let me ask you this &@8212; what held you together in combat?&nbsp; What
  keeps you here now?&nbsp; What is it that has you reading this article, by this man whom you don't even know, who's speaking words that sting and/or inspire
  you somewhere deep within?
</p>
<p>
  Love.&nbsp; Not the soft, mushy, fragile, fear-based, self-protective kind&hellip;&nbsp; Real love.&nbsp; The &quot;I will die for you&quot; kind of
  love.&nbsp; The love that we, as warriors, already know how to live.
</p>
<p>
  And, why should you love?&nbsp; Why should you put yourself out there and ask nothing in return?&nbsp; Because, it's where joy lives.&nbsp; It's the closest
  that you're going to get to feeling like you did in war.&nbsp; And, it's your spiritual calling.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="defenders-and-guardians-of-a-different-kind">
  Defenders and Guardians of a Different Kind
</h3>
<p>
  What if you took that kind of love, and stepped-up, once again?&nbsp; This time, not to defend and protect against terrorists, but to defend and protect
  against the limited thinking that keeps people small, insignificant, and/or afraid of their own light and greatness?&nbsp; What if, you made it your mission
  to stop bitching about how much war hurts you, and start adding life to those who're more dead inside then you'll ever be?&nbsp; What if, you just made
  kindness and listening and helping others expand their perspective on living, your purpose for today?&nbsp; What if, you once again, lived an others-centered
  life?
</p>
<p>
  Here's what I want you to understand&hellip;&nbsp; It doesn't matter what job you do.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you turn this way or that way.&nbsp; It
  doesn't even matter if nobody else loves you first.&nbsp; You're a being of love and power.&nbsp; You're capable of choosing, to be lit from within, by
  love.&nbsp; And, when you operate your life based upon the energy of love, you feel good.&nbsp; You feel significant.&nbsp; You feel blessed.&nbsp; You're
  powerful.
</p>
<p>
  It's that fucking simple &#8212; there's no secret to purpose.&nbsp; You choose, from which energy, that you'll operate.&nbsp; Love empowers and nourishes
  you.&nbsp; Hate and me-centeredness doesn't.
</p>
<p>
  Am I being flippant, by making this seem simple?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I know that we have PTSD, TBIs, physical wounds, losses, that we're grieving &#8212; Hell, I
  know this all too fucking well.&nbsp; I know that you get moody and you don't necessarily mean to flip-out on people.&nbsp; And yes, there's a place for
  medication and/or counseling and/or various types of therapy.&nbsp; But, in all of the biggest changes and/or transformations in life, whether or not you
  end-up with a life that feels good comes down to this&hellip;&nbsp; The perspective that you choose to have &#8212; the energy that you choose to live from.
</p>
<p>
  You can be wounded and not be an asshole.&nbsp; You can be wounded and be happy.&nbsp; You can live from a place of gratitude and positive energy.&nbsp; You
  can choose to stop bitching, stop focusing on the negative, and start doing the work of healing and post-traumatic growth.&nbsp; That work means you start by
  humbling yourself to accept what you cannot change and that you change what you can.
</p>
<p>
  You can step-up and choose to live, for something other, and greater than yourself.&nbsp; Loving others, will give you back your sense of significance.&nbsp;
  It's the key to every, meaningful, life.&nbsp; And, you can start choosing to live by love &#8212; right fucking now.
</p>
