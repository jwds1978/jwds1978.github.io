<p>
  Today, in Brussels Central Station, Belgian troops shot a suspected &quot;terrorist&quot; bomber.&nbsp; However, there were no other casualties though.&nbsp;
  The situation was brought under control, after people were evacuated, officials said.
</p>
<p>
  Eric Van Der Sypt &#8212; federal prosecutor &#8212; told reporters, ~3 hours after the incident, that a small blast was being treated as a &quot;terrorist
  attack&quot;.&nbsp; He said that the man's identity was still unknown and it was still unclear if the man was dead.&nbsp; The suspect was still inside of the
  station, he added.
</p>
<p>
  He declined to comment on witness accounts that the man had shouted Islamist slogans, including &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; &#8212; God is greater, in Arabic &#8212;
  before detonating a device on a luggage trolley, inside of an underground concourse, at the rail station.
</p>

<p>
  Around about 2030, police had evacuated the station and surrounding areas of historic downtown Brussels.&nbsp; While the streets had been busy, with tourists
  and locals enjoying a hot evening, they were soon rather deserted and calm.&nbsp; Rail traffic was, for the most part, suspended.
</p>
<p>
  A station employee, Nicolas Van Herrewegen, told public broadcaster RTBF that he saw a man shouting within a lower-level of the 1930s station that serves
  lines running under the city center.&nbsp; He then appeared to yell &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; in Arabic and detonated something upon a luggage trolley.&nbsp;
  Herrewegen indicated that people, standing within 3 meters of the aforementioned trolley, were unhurt.
</p>
<p>
  The national alert-level was maintained, at its 2<sup>nd</sup>-highest level, as the Prime Minister &#8212; Charles Michel &#8212; consulted with his security
  advisers.

<p>
  Home to the headquarters of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the European Union, the Belgian capital's been on high-alert,
  since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell launched an attack killing 130 people in Paris during November 2015.&nbsp; A mere 4 months later, associates of
  those attackers, killed 32 people in their home city &#8212; including, bombs loaded on trolleys, at Brussels Airport.
</p>
<p>
  Since the Paris attacks, combat-troops have been a fixture, at transport hubs and within primary public areas.&nbsp; A series of further attacks, within
  neighbouring France and Germany over the past year &#8212; as well as, recent bloodshed, in London and Manchester &#8212; have added to the anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  Jean-Michel Michel, the station-master, was quoted by DH newspaper as having said:
  <blockquote>
    We heard the explosion.&nbsp; My colleague thought it was a bomb.&nbsp; The explosion was on the mezzanine level.&nbsp; The man went down to platforms 3 and
    4.&nbsp; He said &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    &hellip;<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    I would put him at about 35 years old.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Prosecutor, Van Der Sypt, said:
  <blockquote>
    At about 08:30 PM there was an explosion in the Central Station, relatively small in size.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The suspected perpetrator was neutralized by the soldiers present.&nbsp; We cannot confirm if the man is still alive or dead.&nbsp; There were no further
    victims.&nbsp; We consider this a terrorist attack.
  </blockquote>
