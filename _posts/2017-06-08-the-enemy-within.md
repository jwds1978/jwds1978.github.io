  In recent months, there has been a great deal of information and reports in the media, about the increase in suicide for soldiers and veterans.&nbsp; Military
  sources have also confirmed dramatic increases in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among returning veterans.&nbsp; Most experts contend that these rates
  of depression, <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>, and suicide will continue to rise in the coming years &#8212; the government lacks
  the capacity to, adequately, meet the needs of returning military and veterans.&nbsp; This means that these individuals will look beyond the government and
  increasingly turn to both public and private providers for their mental health care.

  Between the Ears
</h3>
<p>
  Produced by Eleanor McDowall with Matthew Green:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-between-the-ears">
    What happens when your home turns into a combat zone?&nbsp; When the sound of children playing, a kettle whistling, or a car backfiring transports your
    loved one back to a killing ground in Afghanistan or Iraq?<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Night terrors, flashbacks and the hidden cost of war &#8212; this Between the Ears explores the inner lives of women who care for former service personnel
    suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    We hear a delicate and often wrenching patchwork of audio diaries and interviews recorded in kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms at moments when couples hit
    breaking point or encounter unexpected moments of tenderness.&nbsp; This fierce and intimate portrait reveals the true impact of military campaigns on
    British families &#8212; and the sacrifices made by a generation of women who refuse to give up on the soldiers they love.

  Canada's Military Lost More Soldiers to Suicide
</h3>
<p>
  Canada's military is under pressure to do more, to look after the mental health of its soldiers, after new statistics show that the armed forces have lost
  more personnel to suicide than those killed in combat in Afghanistan.
</p>
<p>
  NDP MP Jack Harris said that the &quot;shocking&quot; numbers should prompt the government to &quot;redouble&quot; its efforts to assist soldiers in need of
  help.&nbsp; In an interview, Harris said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-suicide-cclaims-more-soldiers-than-those-killed-by-afghan-combat">
    It underscores the complaints that soldiers have been making, that families have been making, that this is a real problem that is not being fully addressed.

  Today, there are good treatments available for <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; When you have <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>, dealing with the past can be hard.&nbsp; Instead of telling others how you feel, you may keep your
  feelings bottled-up.&nbsp; But, talking with a therapist can help you get better.
</p>
<p>
  Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is one type of counseling.&nbsp; It appears to be the most effective type of counseling for <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; There are different types of cognitive behavioural therapies &#8212; such as, cognitive therapy
  and exposure therapy.&nbsp; There's also a similar kind of therapy, called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), that's used for <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; Medications have also been shown to be effective.&nbsp; A type of drug known as a selective
  serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is also used for depression, is effective for <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.
