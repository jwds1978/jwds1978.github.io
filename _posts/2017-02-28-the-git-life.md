I picked-up an Asus X541U notebook today&hellip;&nbsp; Getting it on-sale for $200-off.

Although I've done a stupid amount of coding from my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over the years using Bluetooth keyboard and/or mouse, I've decided to move back to
a computer as I'm going to get back to development and other stuff ASAP.

The TL;DR here is that I got a new notebook and am going back to work.&nbsp; Since I won't be committing, primarily, from my Note 3 any longer, the majority of
my commits going forward will be PGP-signed.
