I picked-up an Asus X541U notebook today&hellip;&nbsp; Getting it on-sale for $200-off.

Although I've done a stupid amount of coding from my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over the years, using a Bluetooth keyboard and/or mouse, I've decided to move
back to a computer.&nbsp; I'm going getting back to development and other stuff ASAP.

Given that I'll now be, primarily, comitting to Git from my notebook, I'll be able to sign said commits.&nbsp; For the moment, my commits originating from
my Note 3 will still be unsigned.&nbsp; However, all of the ones from my notebook will be PGP-signed though.

Having forgotten to pick-up a mouse the other day, below is a cheap-ass mouse that I just got from Dollarama.
