<p>
  So, I was at <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-elgin-street-mission" rel="me" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Elgin Street Mission</a>
  earlier today for lunch and to follow-up with somebody that we'll call Pooh Woodill.
</p>
<p>
  After eating, I went upstairs to The Mission's office.&nbsp; The unknown woman on the intercom advised me that Pooh was downstairs in the kitchen and to go
  there to talk with him.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Given that, I go back downstairs and proceed to knock on the door.&nbsp; After roughly 20-something minutes of knocking, going unanswered, I head back into
  The Blue Door.&nbsp; There, I ask one of the staff if they know where Pooh is.
</p>
<p>
  This unknown staff person tells me that Pooh's next door, where I had been banging/knocking on the door, in the kitchen.&nbsp; He tells me that he'll go get
  him for me and to wait in the hall at the aforementioned door.&nbsp; After aroundabout 30-something minutes of further waiting and occasional knocking, still
  going unanswered, I return to The Blue Door.
</p>
<p>
  The staff member that I'd spoken with is just standing around doing not much of anything.&nbsp; He tells me that he'd gone next door and told Pooh that I was
  at the door waiting for him.&nbsp; However, Pooh made it abundantly clear that he had no intention of actually speaking with me though.
</p>
<p>
  I left there, frustrated and pissed-off, heading to Tom Davies Centre.&nbsp; My intent, by this point, was to officially file a claim and get the legal
  process started.&nbsp; While the fine for corporations, under the
  <a

    title="Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 11">
    Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)
  </a>,
  is $100,000 per, I'd given them going on a week to resolve the issue internally.&nbsp; However, no effort was made to follow-up with me nor had any apparent
  action been taken.
</p>
<p>
  The service desk at Tom Davies referred me to by-law enforcement.&nbsp; While uncertain what authority they had regarding this, I did as directed and went to
  by-law.&nbsp; By-law told me that it's not, as I'd expected, within their pervue.&nbsp; They referred me next door to the police station, in hopes that they'd
  know where to contact about accessibility law violations.
</p>
<p>
  The GSPS officer at the information desk was quite helpful.&nbsp; He asked me to have a seat while he did some research into the relevant laws and acts.&nbsp;
  He came back, after a short time, with a phone number for the
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-human-rights-legal-support-centre" rel="me" title="Human Rights Legal Support Centre">
    Human Rights Legal Support Centre
  </a>.&nbsp;
  He proceeded to offer the use of a phone there.&nbsp; However, as I've got a cell phone, I simply thanked him and went on my way.
</p>
<p>
  From there, I made my way to the library.&nbsp; Upon arrival, I called the HRLSC and described what had happened to me.&nbsp; They advised me that it was
  absolutely a human rights issue and is within their scope.&nbsp; They opened a file for me and e-mailed me further documentation to complete and return to
  them in order to proceed with a formal investigation.
</p>
<p>
  Having printed everything out, over the coming days, I'll work on getting it all filled-out and submitted.&nbsp; I'll then need to serve copies of the
  associated paperwork to the relevant parties.&nbsp; Then, it's a waiting game for the hearing(s) and/or investigation(s).
