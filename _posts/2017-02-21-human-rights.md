So, I was at <a href="http://www.themission.ca" target="_blank" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Elgin Street Mission</a> earlier today for lunch and to follow-up with somebody that we'll call Pooh Woodill.

After eating, I went upstairs to the officw of The Mission's office. The unknown woman on fhe intercom advisesn me that Pooh is downstairs in the kitchen and to go there to talk with him.

Given that, I go back downstairs and proceed to knock on the door. After roughly 20-something minutes of knocking, going unanswered, I head back into The Blue Door. There, I ask one of the staff if they kniw where Pooh is.

This unknown staff person tells me that Pooh's next door, where I had been banging/knocking on the door, in the kitchen. He tells me that he'll go get him for me and to wait in the hall at the aforementioned door. After aroundabout 30-something minutes of further waiting and occasional knocking, I return to The Blue Door. The staff member that I'd spoken with is just standing around doing not much of anything.

He tells me that he'd gone next door and told Pooh that I was at the door waiting on him. However, Pooh made it abundantly clear that he had no intention of actually speaking with me.

I left there, frustrated and pissed off, heading to Brady Centre. My intent, by this point, was to officially file a claim and get the legal process started. While the fine for corporations, under the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/accessibility-laws" target="_blank" title="Ontario :: Accessibility Laws">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a>, is $100,000 per.

The service desk at Brady Centre referred me to bylaw enforcement. While uncertain what authority they had regarding this, I did as directed and went to bylaw. Bylaw told me that it's not, as I'd expected, within their pervue. They referred me next door to the police station, in hopes that they'd know where to contact about accessibility law violations.

The officer at the information desk was quite helpful. He asked me to have a seat while he did some research into the relevant laws and acts. He came back, after a short time, with the phone number for the <a href="http://www.hrlsc.on.ca" target="_blank" title="Human Rights Legal Support Centre">Human Rights Legal Support Centre</a>. He proceeded to offer the use of a phone there. However,as I've got a cell phone, I simply thanked him and went on my way.

From there, I made my way to the library. There, I called the HRLSC and deacribed what had happened to me. They advised me that it was absolutely a human rights issue and within their scope. They open a file for me and e-mailed me further documentation to complete and return to them in order to proceed with a formal investigation.

Having printed everything out, over the coming days, I'll work on getting it all filled-out and submitted. I'llbthen need to serve copies of the associated paperwork to the relevant parties. Then, it's a waiting game for the hearing(s) and/or investigation(s).
