title: "The Moral Logic of Survivor Guilt"
---

<p>
  If there's one thing we have learned from returning war veterans &#8212; especially, those of the last decade &#8212; it's that the emotional reality of the
  soldier at home's often at odds with that of the civilian public which they left behind.&nbsp; And, while friends and families of returning service members
  may be experiencing gratefulness and/or relief, many of those they've welcomed home are likely struggling with other emotions.
</p>
<p>
  High on that list of emotions, is guilt.&nbsp; Soldiers often carry this burden home &#8212; survivor guilt being, perhaps, the kind most familiar to
  us.&nbsp; In war, standing here rather than there can save your life, but cost a buddy his.&nbsp; It's fucking luck, but you feel responsible though.&nbsp;
  The guilt begins an endless loop of counterfactuals &#8212; thoughts that you could've and/or should've done otherwise &#8212; though, in fact, you did
  nothing wrong.&nbsp; The feelings are, of course, not restricted to the battle-field.&nbsp; But, given the magnitude of loss during war, they hang heavy
  there, and are pervasive.&nbsp; And, they raise the question of just how irrational those feelings are&hellip;&nbsp; If they aren't, of what is the basis of
  their reasonableness?

  Captain Adrian Bonenberger, head of a unit in Afghanistan that James Dao and other journalists of The New York Times reported on in their series
  &quot;<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-a-year-at-war" rel="me" title="A Year at War">A Year at War</a>&quot;,
  <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-after-combat-the-unexpected-perils-of-coming-home" rel="me"
    title="After Combat, the Unexpected Perils of Coming Home">
    pondered those questions
  </a>
  as he thought about Specialist Jeremiah Pulaski.&nbsp; Jeremiah was killed by police in the wake of a deadly bar fight &#8212; shortly, after he'd returned
  home.&nbsp; Back in Afghanistan, Pulaski had saved Bonenberger's life &#8212; twice in a single day.&nbsp; But, when Pulaski needed help, Bonenberger couldn't
  be there for him:
  <blockquote>
    When he was in trouble, he was alone.&nbsp; We were in trouble, he was there for us.&nbsp; I know it's not rational or reasonable.&nbsp; There's nothing
    logical about it.&nbsp; But, I feel responsible.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  But how unreasonable is that feeling?&nbsp; Subjective guilt, associated with this sense of responsibility, is thought to be irrational because one feels
  guilty despite the fact that he knows he's done nothing wrong.&nbsp; Objective and/or rational guilt, by contrast &#8212; guilt that's &quot;fitting&quot; to
  one's actions &#8212; accurately, tracks real wrong-doing and/or culpability&hellip;&nbsp; Guilt's appropriate because one acted to, deliberately, harm
  someone and/or could have prevented harm and didn't.&nbsp; Blameworthiness, here, depends upon the idea that a person could've done something other than what
  he did.&nbsp; And, so he's held responsible and/or accountable, by himself and/or others.
</p>
<p>
  But as Bonenberger's remarks make clear, we often take responsibility in a way that goes beyond what we can reasonably be held responsible for.&nbsp; And, we
  feel the guilt that comes with that sense of responsibility.&nbsp; Nietzsche, is the modern philosopher who well understood this phenomenon:
  <blockquote>
    Das schlechte Gewissen.
  </blockquote>
  &nbsp;<br />
  Literally, &quot;bad conscience&quot; &#8212; his term for the consciousness of guilt, where one's done no wrong, doesn't grow in the soil where we'd most
  expect it.&nbsp; He argued, such as in prisons, where there are actually &quot;guilty&quot; parties who should feel remorse for wrong-doing.&nbsp; In
  &quot;The Genealogy of Morals&quot;, he appeals to an earlier philosopher, Spinoza, for support:
  <blockquote>
    The bite of conscience.
  </blockquote>
  &nbsp;<br />
  Spinoza writes in the &quot;Ethics&quot; has to do with an &quot;offense&quot; where &quot;something has gone unexpectedly wrong&quot;.&nbsp; As Niezsche
  adds, it's not really a case of &quot;I ought not to have done that&quot;.
</p>

  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="181" />
<p>
  But, what then, is it a case of?&nbsp; Part of the reasonableness of survivor guilt &#8212; and, in a sense, its &quot;fittingness&quot; &#8212; is that it
  tracks a moral significance that's broader than moral action.&nbsp; Who I am, in terms of my character and relationships, and not just what I do, matters
  morally.&nbsp; Of course, character's expressed in action, and when we don't &quot;walk the walk&quot;, we're lacking&hellip;&nbsp; But, it's also expressed
  in emotions and attitudes.&nbsp; Aristotle, in his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, insists on the point:
  <blockquote>
    Virtue is concerned with emotions and actions.
  </blockquote>
  &nbsp;<br />
  To have good character, is to &quot;hit the mean&quot; with respect to both.&nbsp; Moreover, many of the feelings that express character aren't about what one
  has done and/or should've done, but rather, about what one cares deeply about.&nbsp; Though Aristotle doesn't himself talk about guilt, it's the emotion that
  best expresses that conflict &#8212; the desire and/or obligation to help, frustrated by the inability, through no fault of one's own, to do so.&nbsp; To not
  feel the guilt's to be numb to those pulls.&nbsp; It's that vulnerability, those pulls, that Boneneberger feels when he says he wasn't there for Pulaski when
  he needed him.
</p>
<p>
  In many of the interviews that I've conducted with other soldiers, over the years, feelings of guilt and responsibility tangle with feelings of having
  betrayed fellow soldiers.&nbsp; At stake's the duty to those soldiers, the imperative to hold intact the bond that enables them to fight for &#8212; and with
  &#8212; each other in the kind of &quot;sacred band&quot; that the ancients memorialized and that the Marine motto &quot;semper fidelis&quot; captures so
  well.&nbsp; But it's not just duty at work &#8212; it's love.
</p>
<p>
  Service members, especially those of higher ranks, routinely talk about unit members as &quot;my soldiers&quot;, &quot;my sailors&quot;.&nbsp; They're family
  members, their own children of sorts, who've been entrusted to them.&nbsp; To fall short of unconditional care's experienced as a kind of perfidy &#8212; a
  failure to be faithful.&nbsp; Survivor guilt piles on the unconscious thought that luck's part of a zero-sum game&hellip;&nbsp; To have good luck is to
  deprive another of it.&nbsp; The anguish of guilt, its sheer pain, is a way of sharing some of the ill fate.&nbsp; It's a form of empathic distress.
</p>
<p>
  Many philosophers have looked to other terms to define the feeling.&nbsp; What they've come up with is &quot;agent-regret&quot; &#8212; a term coined by the
  British philosopher, Bernard Williams, but used by many others.&nbsp; The classic scenario isn't so much one of good luck &#8212; as in survivor guilt &#8212;
  but, rather, of bad luck&hellip;&nbsp; Typically, having to do with accidents, where again, there's little or no culpability for the harms caused.&nbsp; In
  these cases, people may be causally responsible for harm &#8212; they bring about the harm through their agency &#8212; but, they aren't morally responsible
  for what happened.
</p>
<p>
  But to my ear, agent-regret is simply tone-deaf to how subjective the guilt feels.&nbsp; Despite the insertion of &quot;agent&quot;, it sounds as passive and
  flat as &quot;regretting that the weather's bad&quot;.&nbsp; Or, more tellingly, as removed from empathic distress as the message sent to the next of
  kin&hellip;&nbsp; After an official knock on the door:
  <blockquote>
    The Minister of Defense, regrets to inform you, that&hellip;
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, the other soldiers that I've spoken with, involved in friendly-fire accidents that took their comrades' lives, didn't feel regret for what happened
  &#8212; rather, deep, raw, and unabashed guilt.&nbsp; And, the guilt persisted long after they were formally investigated, and ultimately exonerated.&nbsp; In
  one wrenching case of April 2003 in Iraq, the gun on a Bradley fighting vehicle mis-fired &#8212; blowing off most of the face of Private Joseph Mayek who
  happened to be standing guard near the vehicle.&nbsp; The accident was, ultimately, traced to a faulty replacement battery that the commander-in-charge had
  authorized.&nbsp; When the Bradley's ignition was turned on, the replacement battery in the turret &#8212; a Marine battery, rather than an Army one &#8212;
  failed to shut-off current to the gun.&nbsp; Mayek, who was 20-years of age, died.
</p>
<p>
  The Army officer-in-charge &#8212; then Captain &#8212; John Prior, reconstructed the ghastly scene, and the failed attempts in the medic tent to save Mayek's
  life, for me.&nbsp; He then turned to his feelings of responsibility:
  <blockquote>
    I'm the one who placed the vehicles.&nbsp; I'm the one who set the security.&nbsp; As with most accidents, I'm not in jail right now.&nbsp; Clearly, I
    wasn't egregiously responsible.&nbsp; But, it is a comedy of errors.&nbsp; Any one of a dozen decisions made over the course of a two-month period and none
    of them really occurs to you at the time.&nbsp; Any one of those made differently may have saved his life.&nbsp; So, I dealt with and still deal with the
    guilt of having cost him his life essentially&hellip;&nbsp; There's probably not a day that doesn't go by that I don't think about it, at least fleetingly.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  What Prior feels are feelings of guilt, and not simply, regret that things didn't work-out differently.&nbsp; He feels the awful weight of self-indictment,
  the empathy with the victim and survivors, and the need to make moral repair.&nbsp; If he didn't feel that, we'd more than likely think less of him as a
  commander.
</p>
<p>
  In his case, moral repair came through an empathic and painful connection with Mayek's mother.&nbsp; After the fratricide, Prior and his 1<sup>st</sup>
  sergeant wrote a letter to Mayek's mother.&nbsp; And, for some time after, she replied with care packages to the company and with letters.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, it
  was terrible&quot;, said Prior.&nbsp; &quot;The letters weren't just very matter of fact &#8212; here's what we did today &#8212; it was more like a mother
  writing to her son&quot;.&nbsp; Prior had become the son who was no longer.&nbsp; &quot;It was her way of dealing with the grief&quot;, said Prior.&nbsp;
  &quot;And, so I had a responsibility to try to give back&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  In all this, we may say guilt &#8212; subjective guilt &#8212; has a redemptive side.&nbsp; It's a way that soldiers impose moral order on the chaos and awful
  randomness of war's violence.&nbsp; It's a way of humanizing war for themselves, for their buddies, and for civilians too.
</p>
<p>
  But, if that's all that's involved, it sounds too moralistic.&nbsp; It makes guilt appropriate and/or fitting because it's good for society.&nbsp; It's the
  way that we all can deal with war.&nbsp; Perhaps, instead, we want to say that it's fitting because it's evolutionarily adaptive in the way that fear
  is.&nbsp; But, again, this doesn't do justice to the phenomenon.&nbsp; The guilt that soldiers feel isn't just morally expedient and/or
  species-adaptive.&nbsp; It's fitting because it gets right certain moral and/or evaluative features of a soldier's world &#8212; that good soldiers depend on
  each other, come to love each other, and have duties to care and bring each other safely home.&nbsp; Philosophers, at least, since the time of Kant, have
  called these &quot;imperfect duties&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; Even, in the best circumstances, we can't perfectly fulfill them.&nbsp; And, so, what duties to others
  need to make room for, even in a soldier's life of service and sacrifice, are duties to self, of self-forgiveness, and of self-empathy.&nbsp; These are a part
  of full moral repair.
