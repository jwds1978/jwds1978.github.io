  Do you ever feel like your blog's stuck in quicksand?&nbsp; You're writing a lot of posts.&nbsp; You're promoting them.&nbsp; You're responding to each and
  every commenter as if they were your bestest of friends.
</p>
<p>
  But, it's not working though.&nbsp; The more that you work, the harder that you struggle &#8212; the deeper that you sink.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, it may be a
  little hard to swallow, but you could simply suck at writing.
</p>
<p>
  That's not the only reason why people fail.&nbsp; Some people are just lazy, thinking that it's going to happen, without doing any work.&nbsp; Other people,
  never learn how to promote their posts.&nbsp; Others still, are totally anonymous &#8212; needing to improve their connections, before they can succeed.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are also bloggers who do all of that right, and they're still stuck.&nbsp; They're working their asses off, doing everything imaginable to
  promote their blogs, and they're even networking masters who know everybody &#8212; but, they're still failing.&nbsp; And, it's because they suck at writing.
</p>
<p>
  Think about that for a moment.&nbsp; You build it and they come&hellip;&nbsp; But, it sucks &#8212; they leave.&nbsp; And, another potentially great blog
  bites the dust.
</p>

  Sucking at Writing, Sucks for Blogging
</h3>
<p>
  Let's start with a little mental exercise.
</p>
<p>
  Pretend that you're standing in front of someone, trying to convince them of something.&nbsp; You could be trying to persuade them to bet on one sports team
  over another, to buy a new car, or that the climax scene in The Devil's Advocate is overacted and stupid &#8212; doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>
  Now, pretend that you've given your entire persuasive argument to a transcriptionist instead of to the person that you're trying to convince.&nbsp; The
  transcriptionist will write down all of your words and then hand them over for your target to read.
</p>
<p>
  Do you see a problem?
</p>
<p>
  You've just been robbed of your body language, your tone of voice, your subtle inflections, your facial expressions, and your withering stare.&nbsp; And, all
  of this while you're trying to make somebody change their mind&hellip;&nbsp; Hopefully, to tell their friends to do the same.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you use a lot of media &#8212; audio and/or video &#8212; this is your task every time that you write on your blog.&nbsp; You're trying to persuade
  people to feel what you feel, to tell their friends about you, and to possibly even buy from you &#8212; using only words.&nbsp; Some studies suggest that
  words may comprise a mere 7% of your total communications arsenal.
</p>
<p>
  You've got your hands tied behind your back, to the tune of 93%, when you're writing words on your blog.&nbsp; So, you'd better make them count.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="calling-bs">
  Calling BS
</h3>
<p>
  You may think that this is nothing more than a lot of hot air.
</p>
<p>
  You may be sitting there and saying, &quot;Words are words.&nbsp; As long as the reader can understand the message, that's all that matters&quot;.&nbsp; And,
  you're right.&nbsp; Tossing together words will indeed get your message across.&nbsp; Your reader will, in fact, be informed.&nbsp; Unless you're incompetent,
  that reader will understand you.
</p>
<p>
  But, will they be moved though?&nbsp; Will they feel that they must share your post with their friends?&nbsp; Will they come back to that post over and over
  again?&nbsp; Will they join your list and/or subscribe to your feed, so that they don't miss your future postings?&nbsp; Will they feel a connection with you
  that they'll remember the next time that your paths cross?
</p>
<p>
  I sort of doubt it.&nbsp; Nobody has ever said, &quot;Hey, Jim!&nbsp; You must drop absolutely everything and check out this post that I just read!&nbsp; It
  wasn't well-written, but man, did it objectively convey some information&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Do you want your message to spread?&nbsp; Do you want your posts to go viral?
</p>
<p>
  If so, don't just &quot;effectively convey your message&quot;. Instead, write your posts well enough, and strongly enough, that your words will &#8212; as
  somebody once told me &#8212; &quot;hit people with a baseball bat&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="knowing-you-suck">
  Knowing You Suck
</h3>
<p>
  I'm not saying that you suck&hellip;&nbsp; You may not suck at all.&nbsp; If you're not getting enough traffic, it's possible that you haven't found a good
  traffic strategy.&nbsp; You may be too new and/or may have just gotten some unlucky breaks.
</p>
<p>
  But, let's at least consider the possibility that your writing sucks.&nbsp; Let's take a good, hard, and honest look.
</p>
<p>
  Now, even if you're brand new and haven't gotten much of an audience, I'm sure that at least a few people are reading your posts.&nbsp; So, right now, think
  of those people&hellip;&nbsp; Eliminate your best friend, cousin, dad, mom, and anyone else whom would tell you that your posts are great even if they're
  not.&nbsp; Then, ask yourself some questions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are those people &#8212; even if there are only a few of them &#8212; sharing your posts without you asking them to do so?&nbsp; And, if they do, what
      comments &#8212; &quot;Here's a useful post.&quot; versus &quot;This is amazing!&quot; &#8212; are they making when they share them?
    </li>
    <li>
      When people leave comments on your blog, are they raving comments, or are they non-committal comments such as &quot;You make an interesting point&quot;?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you ever get comments, e-mails, Facebook mentions, and/or tweets that are similar to any of the below?
      <ul>
        <li>
          &quot;This is exactly what I needed right now.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          &quot;You've really opened my eyes.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          &quot;You said exactly what I was thinking.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          &quot;This is going to make a huge difference in my life/business&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          &quot;This is absolutely amazing/astonishing/awesome/moving.&quot;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you ever receive thanks for your posts?&nbsp; I'm talking about literal thanks &#8212; &quot;Thank you for writing this&quot; or similar.&nbsp; Bear in
      mind that &quot;this was helpful&quot; isn't a thank you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you ever get e-mails from readers, in which they share their own personal stories, that are similar to what you wrote about within your post?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="if-you-suck">
  If You Suck
</h3>
<p>
  Practice.
</p>
<p>
  This is the part where I give you the magic formula for becoming an amazing writer, eh?
</p>
<p>
  Well, I've got bad news for you.&nbsp; I don't have a magic formula&hellip;&nbsp; Sorry.
</p>
<p>
  Well, I do have a formula, but it's not magic though.&nbsp; It's the one that I just gave you&hellip;&nbsp; Practice.
</p>
<p>
  The honest answer as to how you improve as a writer is to do more writing &#8212; and, more reading.&nbsp; No matter what you learn, and no matter what
  whiz-bang writing course you buy, there's no substitute in the end for simply gutting it out and putting more words on the page.
</p>
<p>
  So, if you suck, keep writing.&nbsp; Write through &quot;the suck&quot;.&nbsp; Write a crap-load of posts.&nbsp; Write copy, e-books, letters to the editor,
  novels, posts, screenplays, whatever.
</p>
<p>
  It's like clearing a drain&hellip;&nbsp; There's a certain amount of crap in there, and the only way to get it out, is to get it out.&nbsp; Ship what you can
  and throw out the bad stuff, if you must &#8212; keep writing.
</p>
<p>
  The good news, is that none of this is magic, or the elusive concept of &quot;artistry&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of innate talent, the more that you read and write, the better a writer you'll become.&nbsp; You'll begin to recognize that certain sentences work,
  while others don't.
</p>
<p>
  You know how when you're reading something, and it just kind of loses its &quot;flow&quot;?&nbsp; You'll start to see that when you read your own
  writing&hellip;&nbsp; When you do, you'll go back and make a change, then read it again and see if it flows any better.&nbsp; You'll learn to do that, until
  you get it right.
</p>
<p>
  I wish that I had an easier system, but I don't.&nbsp; Ask any good writer how they got good, and they'll tell you, &quot;I kept writing&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Writing isn't an art &#8212; not the kind of art that you're born able to do.&nbsp; Writing's a job.&nbsp; You put your ass in a chair and you
  work&hellip;&nbsp; And, work&hellip;&nbsp; And, work.&nbsp; Great writers are great because they put in their <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-10000-hours" rel="me" title="10,000 hours">10,000 hours</a>&hellip;&nbsp; That's all.
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I spend around about 1,000 hours or so per year putting words on the page.

  Step-by-Step Plan to Get More Traffic
</h3>
<p>
  Here's what to do:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Don't panic.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          If it looks as though you may suck as a writer, don't beat yourself up.&nbsp; Stephen King says that he believes, with a lot of practice, it's
          possible to turn a merely competent writer into a good one &#8212; I'd tend to agree.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill your toolbox.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Speaking of Stephen King, pick-up his book <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft" rel="me"
            title="On Writing: A Memoir Of The Craft">On Writing</a>.&nbsp; It's without question the best book that I've ever read on the actual practice of
          writing.&nbsp; Do this step, whether you like Stephen King or not, and do it even if you're a non-fiction writer &#8212; as most bloggers are.&nbsp;
          Then, study it.&nbsp; Trust me on this one.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Write&hellip;&nbsp; Write&hellip;&nbsp; Write.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Put in your hours.&nbsp; It's not glamorous, but this is how you get better though.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you start to put as much conscious attention on your style and delivery, as you put on your actual content, people will &#8212; with time &#8212;
          start to share your posts.&nbsp; They'll start to tell their friends how amazing those posts are.&nbsp; They'll start to send you notes and leave you
          comments&hellip;&nbsp; Thanking you, for writing what you've written.&nbsp; You'll gain fans instead of mere visitors.&nbsp; And, those fans, will
          tell their friends about you.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          When that happens, just watch what happens to your traffic.&nbsp; Wait until you see how much more effective your guest posts become.&nbsp; Wait until
          you see how many more people follow your calls to action, join your list, and/or become customers.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Writing well requires hard work.&nbsp; There's no substitute for hard work.&nbsp; However, that's good news &#8212; few of your competitors are
          willing to put-in the time and effort to become better.&nbsp; Are you?
        </li>
      </ul>

  </ol>
