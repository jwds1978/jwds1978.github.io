<p>
  Firstly, let's get the definition out of the way&hellip;&nbsp; Hypervigilance is an enhanced state of sensory sensitivity, accompanied by an exaggerated
  intensity of behaviours, whose purpose is to detect threats.&nbsp; Although it may feel like paranoia, they're not the same thing.
</p>
<p>
  Discarding the military for a moment, and thinking of PTSD in general, a symptom of PTSD is hypervigilance.&nbsp; This means, what society classifies as
  normal &#8212; being a person who lacks significant deviation from society and/or conforms to the ideals of society &#8212; typically, has little to no
  requirement for being hypervigilant.&nbsp; Without fear, there's no requirement to be looking for something.&nbsp; The most a civilian's, partially
  hypervigilant, is within daily acts of driving a motor vehicle and crossing the road.&nbsp; That's the, typical, extent of a civilian's hypervigilance.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  A rape victim &#8212; a female raped by a male &#8212; due to the fear endured, from being rendered powerless during the rape, the victim now creates a state
  of hypervigilance and/or awareness for any male who looks remotely threatening to them.&nbsp; They fear being raped again &#8212; the brain has created an
  awareness and/or heightened state of alertness toward males.
</p>
<p>
  What have we learnt thus far?&nbsp; We've learnt that, without any military training whatsoever, the brain can create a hypervigilant state in order to
  identify specific fears.
</p>
<p>
  The military trains every recruit to a heightened level of hypervigilant status.&nbsp; This occurs from learning drill, to patrolling and tactics, to weapons,
  and so forth.&nbsp; You're trained to identify threats, before the threats identify you.&nbsp; What's a threat?&nbsp; Something which your brain distinguishes
  as a fear.&nbsp; Without any exposure to an actual real-life trauma, every soldier's now been trained to a heightened symptom of PTSD, through behavioural
  modification.&nbsp; The fear that's used for behavioural modification's imposed by a reward and punishment type of system.&nbsp; If you do good, you don't get
  punished.&nbsp; If you do bad, you get punished.&nbsp; Hell, even if you do good, you may still get punished at times.&nbsp; This mentally challenges you to
  strive for perfection &#8212; not just meeting a standard, but to perform to a high-level and work as a team.&nbsp; Creating a team environment aids in the
  process &#8212; if you fail, you're punished by your peers.&nbsp; Fear, in all of its forms, is an exceptional motivator.
</p>
<p>
  Depending upon your role within any force, depends upon how far your hypervigilant state will be trained.&nbsp; Infantry, for example, are trained to be
  extremely aware of absoutely everything around them.&nbsp; Within a crowd, the slightest movement's detected &#8212; eyes scanning for threats.&nbsp;
  Patrolling, down a city street &#8212; eyes constantly scanning cars, doors, windows, etc. for any movement and/or identification of an object that doesn't
  look quite right.&nbsp; IEDs, often, fit right-in with their surroundings.&nbsp; So, even looking right's a threat.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the simplest of all issues combined&hellip;&nbsp; A person who's been trained to be hypervigilant prior to their developing PTSD.&nbsp; What have we
  learnt thus far?&nbsp; The military trained you to be hypervigilant, yet when PTSD develops, the brain also (by itself) creates a hypervigilant state &#8212;
  1 + 1 = 2.
</p>
<p>
  Why do military, with PTSD, have a much worse state of hypervigilance and/or alertness?&nbsp; Simply put, not only have you been trained with a symptom of
  PTSD, but upon developing PTSD, the symptom's now exacerbated in severity due to its pre-existence.&nbsp; One doesn't cancel the other out.&nbsp; Rather, 1 +
  1 = 2 &#8212; PTSD Hypervigilance + Military Training Hypervigilance = Double the Symptom Severity.
