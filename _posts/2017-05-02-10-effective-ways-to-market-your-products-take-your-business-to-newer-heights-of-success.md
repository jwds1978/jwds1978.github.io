<h3 id="the-power-of-e-mail">
  The Power of E-mail
</h3>
<p>
  E-mail marketing's the most conventional and still <sup>#</sup>1 technique in all of the marketing guide books.&nbsp; Some of the marketing experts say that
  e-mail marketing offers more conversion than that of social media.&nbsp; On social media platforms, you have to compete for attention.&nbsp; However, through
  e-mail, you get to form a personal and one-on-one connection with your target audience.
</p>
<p>
  Maintain a list &#8212; and, keep building upon it &#8212; of people who want to hear from you.&nbsp; You can use a mailing service to educate them and also
  to effectively engage with them.&nbsp; If your customers are used to seeing valuable content from you, an e-mail about your latest products and/or a seasonal
  offer's more likely to convert into sales.

<h3 id="maintain-a-blog">
  Maintain a Blog
</h3>
<p>
  While developing a content strategy, always give importance to blog posts.&nbsp; You can make use of a blog and/or
  <a href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_Business" rel="external" target="_blank" title="">yourÂ business Web site</a> to announce your product and/or
  share valuable customer information.&nbsp; You can make your blogs more interactive, by telling consumers about the products, and also include a widget and/or
  button for the customers to directly buy your products.
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining a blog's a smart way to enhance your SEO &#8212; search engine optimization &#8212; performance&hellip;&nbsp; Also, to ensure your brand exposure
  to a somewhat wider consumer base.&nbsp; While social platforms may limit your access, an established blog can offer you unlimited opportunities to engage
  with loyal visitors.&nbsp; Always, take initiative to move your new leads and/or existing customers to blogs, by initiating call-to-actions to join your
  mailing lists.

<p>
  You have to work-out a winning content strategy, if you want to share your product story with the customers.&nbsp; Even if you're retweeting user content
  and/or trying to create some engaging visual content to be shared through social media and/or doing bulk mailing, always craft a smart content strategy and
  ensure that sales are steadily growing with it.&nbsp; Also, don't forget to effectively incorporate a call-to-action to each post &#8212; urging the users to
  share the post, sign-up for e-mail alerts, and/or even buy the product.

<h3 id="employ-brand-ambassadors">
  Employ Brand Ambassadors
</h3>
<p>
  We're not talking about the conventional brand ambassadors, such as film stars and/or celebrities.&nbsp; Have you noticed any of your customers rave about you
  on social media without any incentives from you?&nbsp; They can be the natural brand ambassadors for you &#8212; getting you access to spaces, in which, you
  can't directly enter/intrude yourself.&nbsp; Once you've identified such ambassadors, try to get into mutually beneficial deals with them.&nbsp; Consider
  paying them and/or exchanging products and/or services with them.

  Once you have a clear-cut understanding of your target group, identify where your customers hang-out.&nbsp; They could be anywhere &#8212; Facebook,
  Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.&nbsp; Once you pin-point the appropriate social platform(s), start sharing posts about your products within each of these
  channels, with customized content.&nbsp; Try to make social promotions more visual, so that the new-age users can easily connect with them.
</p>
<p>
  You need to use the native language of the platform, paying keen attention to the context, in order to get people to hear your story on social media and act
  upon it.&nbsp; Try to understand the differences and nuances, of each of these unique social platforms, to adopt the best content strategies.

  newsletters, etc. &#8212; to earn points and/or clear various levels of the contest to grab prizes and/or enjoy discounts.
