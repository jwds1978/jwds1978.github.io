  This post was inspired by <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-patience-masons-ptsd-blog-new-book-idea-1" rel="me"
    title="Patience Mason's PTSD Blog: New book idea #1">Patience Mason's post</a> about her book idea.&nbsp; She asks:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-patience-masons-ptsd-blog-new-book-idea-1">
    Reality is that most people who come back from war, or survive another trauma, are not fine, so if that might fit you, here are some questions to think
    about:<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    How or why might you be fucked up?&nbsp; Are you saying or thinking if you'd been through what I've been through, you'd be fucked up too?&nbsp; If you had
    my wife, husband, boss, kids, etc.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    How are you insecure?&nbsp; Are you sleeping with a gun?&nbsp; Driving like a maniac?&nbsp; Not trusting anyone?<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    How are you numb?&nbsp; Do you have to be in danger to feel alive?&nbsp; Can you feel sad?&nbsp; Can you feel love?<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    How are you egotistical?&nbsp; Do you want everything your way?&nbsp; Is there flexibility in your relationships?&nbsp; Do you yell if things are not done
    &quot;right&quot;?<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Think about these questions and see if you are actually fine or not.

  I'd doubt you were in the military and/or a veteran, if you couldn't recite two or more times that a curious and/or insensitive clod trampled through your
  trauma, to relive their boyhood romanticized thriller of the military life.&nbsp; For the insensitive thinking, that leads a stranger to ask intimate
  questions, and then discount my story because it doesn't match the official narrative&hellip;&nbsp; Even though, most everybody knows that the government
  and/or television lies about damn near every-fucking-thing.

<p>
  I'm not fine&hellip;&nbsp; Why the fuck would you expect me to be?&nbsp; Because my war was a little war and doesn't matter?&nbsp; I hear this, all too
  fucking often, recently&hellip;&nbsp; Even, from other &#8212; older &#8212; veterans.
</p>
<p>
  I'm angry and full of rage when not numb and/or heavily medicated.&nbsp; Now, hear this &#8212; my witness &#8212; my platoon opened multiple train cars, to
  find them stuffed-full of dead and rotting bodies of adults, children, females, and males alike&hellip;&nbsp; The conditions of those who were interned within
  the death camps&hellip;&nbsp; It was, abso-fucking-lutely, a damned genocide.&nbsp; I've hunted and killed people &#8212; up-close and personal&hellip;&nbsp;
  I didn't have the luxuy of being somewhat detached, as a seaman may be, for exmple.&nbsp; I've had my hand inside of my buddies fucking guts.&nbsp; When I
  returned home, the stupid idiot box repeaters called me a liar &#8212; further, altering people's perceptions of me, as being unstable.&nbsp; Caregivers know
  though, the safest people in the world, are those that are standing next to a veteran with PTSD.

<p>
  After returning home, unchecked PTSD led me to beat a fucktard within an inch of his life&hellip;&nbsp; He needed several reconstructive surgeries and still
  looks disfigured and fucked-up.&nbsp; He'll live out the remainder of his days in a wheelchair and being tube-fed.&nbsp; After being hospitalized in a
  psych-ward, I was transferred to a federal facility, and did a few years of hard-time.
</p>
<p>
  Looking back, I don't necessarily regret harming the PoS, but if I were to find myself in that situation again, I may not be as &quot;violent&quot; with
  him.&nbsp; To give some context to the situation&hellip;&nbsp; My girfriend (of the time) and I were out at a bar; having a good time.&nbsp; I'd gone to the
  washroom at some point throughout the evening.&nbsp; Upon exiting the washroom, I glanced across the bar, to see some shitbag with a knife at her
  throat.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn't take too kindly to this.&nbsp; I didn't want him dead, I wanted him to live&hellip;&nbsp; To be beat within an inch of
  his life, to be allowed to live &#8212; if you can even call it that &#8212; and, have to think of me every damn time that a nursemaid changed his diaper
  and/or fed him.

<p>
  Fast-forward, past the bouts of hospitalizations for suicidal ideation and homelessness, I was finally diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus, amongst other
  shit.&nbsp; Which, seriously exacerbate PTSD &#8212; infusing the flashbacks and hallucinations with sound, while I'm going deaf.

</p>
<p>
  Don't ever forget, I beared witnessed to a massacre &#8212; a genocide, an ethnic cleansing &#8212; and, have killed a fair number of people myself.&nbsp;
  While I can vividly remember, each and every person that I've killed, I'll likely never reveal to anybody just how many there are.&nbsp; Regardless, I'll be
  seeing their faces until the day that I die &#8212; and, perhaps, beyond even.

  Don't misunderstand, I don't regret anything that I'd had to do during war.&nbsp; But, at the same time, I'm not a fucking sociopath.&nbsp; I've done, and
  will do, what needs to be done.&nbsp; However, I do have a conscience nonetheless &#8212; I have to live with the fact that I've hunted and killed
  people.&nbsp; I did it, willingly, so that others wouldn't have to&hellip;&nbsp; I did it, to protect those who weren't able to protect
  themselves&hellip;&nbsp; I did it, to help those who were weak and/or vulnerable.&nbsp; Even now, I'd do it again&hellip;&nbsp; If need be, I
  will&helip;&nbsp; I'll always, to my grave, defend those who may find themselves to be helpless, vulnerable, weak, etc.&nbsp; Within me, beats the heart of a
  warrior.
</p>
<p>
  Today, even if I happen to make perfect financial decisions every month, I can barely get by.&nbsp; I'm only human and am prone to the same mistakes and/or
  stresses as everybody faces.&nbsp; That's a base for a veteran with combat-related PTSD, MST, and/or TBI &#8212; welcome, to our good day.&nbsp; Now, heap on
  hypervigilence and crippling anxiety, that literally, makes your skin crawl&hellip;&nbsp; Welcome, to our good day.&nbsp; For a great day, heap on
  cannabis.&nbsp; I don't make enough money to have that throughout an entire month though.

<p>
  Why the fuck wouldn't I shoot bullet-eyes when you ask me, &quot;are you OK&quot;?&nbsp; No, I'm not &#8212; I'm on the fucking edge.&nbsp; Are you ready to
  listen?
