<p>
  It was a late Friday night, when I'd finished a long round-up of <a href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" rel="external" target="_blank"
  title="Template Monster :: WordPress Themes">WordPress themes</a>, and had completely forgotten that my fridge was empty.&nbsp; I collapsed onto the sofa,
  launched Snapchat, and suddenly my mouth started watering&hellip;&nbsp; My neighbour had posted a picture of himself &#8212; eating a huge, yummy
  burger.&nbsp; The ridiculous tradition to take pics of food, and boast of them publicly, appears to have migrated from Instagram to Snapchat.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Next, what I saw was a 10-second video, advertising a local snack bar, with a home delivery service.&nbsp; The hunger and no energy to cook did their
  part.&nbsp; A click on the ad brought me to the snack bar Web site where I ordered my favourite pasta with mussels and calamari.&nbsp; And, then it hit
  me&hellip;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

  People use Snapchat for the promotion of their businesses.&nbsp; I've been using the app for a long time ow, but have never looked at it from that angle
  before.&nbsp; Giants such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter turned out to be not the only stars in the advertising galaxy.&nbsp; To pass the time before
  getting my pasta, I decided to learn more about Snapchat advertising.&nbp; I was curious as to whether the app would do for promoting my own stuff.&nbsp;
  Here's what I'd found:
  <ul>
    <li>
      According to the latest <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-snapchat-reportedly-hit-160m-daily-users-and-400m-revenue-in-2016" rel="me"
        title="Snapchat reportedly hit 160M daily users and $400M revenue in 2016">data published on TechCrunch</a>, Snapchat has nearly 160,000,000 active
      users per day.&nbsp; That's a big crowd, isn't it?&nbsp; Promoting my stuff within such a densely populated environment's a great opportunity to increase
      my brand awareness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-snapchat-we-can-prove-people-watch-mobile-videos-with-sound" rel="me"
        title="Snapchat: We can prove people watch mobile videos *with* sound">Two-thirds of Snapchat videos</a> are watched with the sound on.&nbsp; To
      compare, 85% of video ads are watched with the sound off on Facebook.&nbsp; It means that prospects can hear my voice &#8212; which, is perfect for
      improving my call-to-action strategy.&nbsp; The voice can be more compelling than the text, if I use the right intonation and message.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users of the app are <a
        href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-snapchat-user-demographics-distribution-of-snapchat-users-in-the-united-states-as-of-february-2016-by-age"
        rel="me" title="Snapchat user demographics: Distribution of Snapchat users in the United States as of February 2016, by age">mostly young
      people</a>.&nbsp; Particularly, 13&#8211;17 years (23%), 18&#8211;24 (37%), and 25&#8211;34 (26%).&nbsp; That's, exactly, what I need&hellip;&nbsp; My
      services could attract a lot of millennials.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  With those and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-top-snapchat-statistics-you-need-to-know-for-business" rel="me"
  title="The Top Snapchat Statistics You Need to Know for Business">other curious stats</a>, I quickly understood that Snapchat was the right advertising
  platform for my business.&nbsp; But, as you may already be well aware, it's all about the budget that you have to spend on ads.&nbsp; So, the next thing that
  I did was research the cost of advertising with Snapchat.&nbsp; There are different types of ads that you can use to promote your business within their
  app.&nbsp; Check them out, and how much they'll cost you, below.

  word about your business&hellip;&nbsp; You'll engage people with it &#8212; keeping them loyal.&nbsp; Have you already tried Snapchat advertising?&nbsp; Feel
