  Tonight, we're going to hear
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-why-i-sued-google-and-won-updated" rel="me" title="Why I Sued Google (and Won) [Updated]">
    a story about a guy named Aaron Greenspan
  </a>,
  who sued AdSense for disabling his account &#8212; and, he won the case.&nbsp; The Google AdSense team has been disabling many accounts to protect other
  publishers and advertisers interests.&nbsp; However, at times, they aren't necessarily correct&hellip;&nbsp; Many people have lost their hard-earned AdSense
  revenue due to having their account(s) disabled.
</p>
<p>
  Undoubtedly, Google AdSense rules the contextual ad space.&nbsp; Regardless, Google will keep serving your ad space with advertisements &#8212; provided, of
  course, that you have a valid Google AdSense account.&nbsp; Otherwise, you have to turn to AdSense-alternative program for your ad revenue stream.

<p>
  This story's about Aaron Greenspan.&nbsp; One fine day, Greenspan received the following e-mail from the AdSense team:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-why-i-sued-google-and-won-updated">
    Your AdSense account for this login is currently disabled.&nbsp; We recommend checking your email inboxes for any messages we may have sent you regarding
    your account status.&nbsp; Sometimes our messages can be caught by email filters, so please be sure to check the Bulk/Spam folders of your email accounts as
    well.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    If your account was disabled for invalid click activity, please visit our Disabled Account FAQ for more information.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Return to AdSense home.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Greenspan was somewhat shocked and amazed by this.&nbsp; He was fairly certain that he'd not committed any fraudulent action(s).&nbsp; Like many others, he
  attempted to contact the Google AdSense team via several methods &#8212; AdSense forum, AdWords, e-mail, etc.&nbsp; He tried everything that he could think
  of, but he was unable to get in-touch with them though.
</p>
<p>
  He'd had almost $721 USD in his account.&nbsp; However, due to Google AdSense policies, he wasn't able to successfully withdraw the monies.&nbsp; I've seen
  similar issues with many bloggers, whose Google AdSense account(s) were suspended and/or terminated &#8212; they lost their monies.
</p>
<p>
  Aaron didn't give up though.&nbsp; He filed a case against the Google AdSense team.&nbsp; After some argument, he won his case.&nbsp; Google AdSense was
  ordered to pay $761 USD &#8212; $721 and $40 for court costs/fees &#8212; toÂ Greenspan.
</p>
<p>
  Many people face the similar problems with their AdSense account(s).&nbsp; Most, will more than likely give up, after trying for a brief period.&nbsp;
  However, I'm sure that Greenspan's story may give you some hope and/or inspiration if it were to happen to you.
