<p>
  As you may or may not have noticed, I've made some changes to the on-site ad units.&nbsp; While I've had no policy violations with my AdSense account, I've
  decided to disable them for awhile &#8212; in favour of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads" rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">Anonymous
  Ads</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a> ad units.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads" rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">A-ADS</a> is a bitcoin online advertising network that doesn't
  collect personal data.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a> is a full and
  self-service advertising network, providing comprehensive and industry leading ad-serving and optimization technologies, for online marketers and Web
  publishers.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  I've been testing both networks for a little bit now.&nbsp; Thus far, I'd have to say that I'm happy with my decision.&nbsp; With <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads" rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">A-ADS</a>, I'm using it as a drop-in replacement for the previous
  AdSense units.&nbsp; With <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a>, I'm making use of their
  pop-under and mobile push-up formats.
</p>
<p>
  Neither the pop-under nor mobile push-up units should be displayed more than once per any given session, minimizing any possible annoyance or intrusion, as
  related to <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>.&nbsp; The banner units are unchanged &#8212; no less/more than prior &#8212; having simply replaced the
  AdSense units.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  My motivation was, quite simply, a financial one.&nbsp; It costs more to run this Web site than most people seem to realize.&nbsp; Although I was getting some
  revenue via AdSense, it was rather insulting &#8212; to say the least.&nbsp; Even with several thousand views each day, I was only making something in the
  order of &lt;$1.00 per month&hellip;&nbsp; Whiskey &#8212; Tango &#8212; Foxtrot?!?
</p>
<p>
  Given that, I was losing significant amounts of money, paying for everything out-of-pocket.&nbsp; At this point, since making the move to <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads" rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">A-ADS</a> and <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a>, I'm now making enough to pay the majority of my
  operating costs via ad-generated revenue.&nbsp; As time goes on, I'd hope to be actually turning a profit.&nbsp; I don't expect to become a billionaire or
  anything, but a healthy revenue-stream &#8212; being, otherwise, unemployable and all &#8212; would be nice though.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  What I also like about both networks, is that I can ultimately receive payment via bitcoin.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads"
    rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">A-ADS</a> pays, directly to my wallet of choice, on a daily basis &#8212; <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-btc"></i>0.001
  <abbr title="Bitcoin">XBT</abbr> minimum.&nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a>
  pays, to may <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-epayments" rel="me" title="ePayments">ePayments</a> account, on a monthly basis &#8212; $100.00 <abbr
    title="United States Dollar">USD</abbr> minimum.&nbsp; From <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-epayments" rel="me" title="ePayments">ePayments</a>,
  I'm able to withdraw to my bitcoin wallet of choice.
</p>
<p>
  Both networks offer other payment methods, with varying thresholds, as well.&nbsp; However, personally, I much prefer to be paid via bitcoin.&nbsp; From my
  bitcoin wallet(s), I'm able to load my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-cryptopay" rel="me" title="Cryptopay">Cryptopay</a> pre-paid credit
  card(s).&nbsp; And, in-turn, I'm then able to pay the bills.&nbsp; <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of whether you're looking for an AdSense alternative, whether by choice or force (i.e. AdSense suspension), I'd encourage you to consider <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-anonymous-ads" rel="me" title="Anonymous Ads">A-ADS</a> and/or <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-propeller-ads" rel="me" title="Propeller Ads">Propeller Ads</a>.
