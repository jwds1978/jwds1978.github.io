title: "Thanks to Today's Musical Google Doodle, In Honour of the Animator Oskar Fischinger, No Work's Getting Done"
---

<p>
  Today's Google Doodle honours what would've been the 117<sup>th</sup> birthday of, German-American abstract artist, Oskar Fischinger.
</p>
<p>
  In Hitler's Germany, Fischinger's musical animations were deemed to be &quot;degenerate art&quot;.&nbsp; In 1936, when an agent from Paramount Pictures
  recruited him to work in America, he left for the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  His work was ground-breaking &#8212; the films were visually stunning, despite being created decades before the existence of computer graphics or music
  videos.&nbsp; Creative lead on the doodle, Leon Hong, expresses just how impressive Fischinger's work was &#8212; and, still is:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-oskar-fischingers-117th-birthday">
    In the world of design, Fischinger is a towering figure, especially in the areas of motion graphics and animation.&nbsp; He is best known for his ability to
    combine impeccably synchronized abstract visuals with musical accompaniment, each frame carefully drawn or photographed by hand.&nbsp; A master of motion
    and color, Fischinger spent months &#8212; sometimes years &#8212; planning and handcrafting his animations.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Not only was Fischinger behind the effects on several movies &#8212; including, Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon &#8212; he invented the
  Lumigraph&hellip;&nbsp; A device that generates chromatic displays with hand movements.&nbsp; Hong says:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-oskar-fischingers-117th-birthday">
    Unsatisfied with traditional media, he also invented a contraption, the Lumigraph, for generating fantastic chromatic displays with hand movements &#8212; a
    sort of optical painting in motion and a precursor to the interactive media and multi-touch games of today.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Fischinger's work to this day remains near-impossible to replicate &#8212; dancing the line between absolute precision and a human touch.&nbsp; Today's Google
  Doodle's meant to pay homage to his work, while letting you get a taste of what it's like to compose your own visual music.
</p>
<p>
  When clicking upon Google's logo, you'll be taken to an interface which operates much like a simple music sequencer.&nbsp; There are 4 instruments to choose
  from.&nbsp; As you click on diamonds, to activate notes, it plays back a loop of your 16-beat melody in real-time &#8212; with colourful shapes, dancing
  around your display.&nbsp; You can adjust the key, the tempo, and add effects &#8212; bitcrusher, delay, phaser &#8212; from within the side-bar.&nbsp; There
  are preset packs, as a bonus.
</p>
<p>
  The interface makes it easy to create atmospheric, flowing, and trippy melodies in Fischinger's style within a matter of minutes &#8212; even, without any
  prior musical knowledge.&nbsp; Combined with the built-in visuals, it's incredibly mesmerizing &#8212; almost therapeutic.&nbsp; When you're done with your
  creation, you save and share it &#8212; you're going to want to.
</p>
<p>
  At 66 years old, in 1967, Fischinger passed away in Los Angeles.&nbsp; However, his legacy's felt to this very day.&nbsp; The artist's daughter spoke to
  Google about the project, saying:
  <blockquote>
    I feel incredibly proud of my family and am delighted to be the daughter of Oskar and Elfriede Fischinger.&nbsp; It means so much to me to see this
    celebration of my father's art.&nbsp; It's wonderful to know that his work, which has been steadily praised since the 1920s, will continue to receive
    worldwide recognition.
  </blockquote>
