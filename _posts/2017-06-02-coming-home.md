  You're thinking, &quot;That doesn't make sense.&nbsp; They're happy to have him home.&nbsp; That's all that matters to them.&nbsp; He's safe and alive&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  True&hellip;&nbsp; That's their first reaction &#8212; lasting until the welcome home hug and the long breathless embrace.&nbsp; It's afterward, when you each
  pull-back and look into the other's eyes.&nbsp; That's when you lose each other.
</p>
<p>
  Let's assume that you're his father.&nbsp; When this vet left for war, he was still your boy &#8212; full of fun and pranks.&nbsp; Life was an open invitation
  to adventure &#8212; anything was possible.&nbsp; That's the image wich has been locked inside of your mind since he left.&nbsp; Your response now, to this
  vet, is to that image.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  However, that's not the image before you now though.&nbsp; His eyes tell you how much that he's changed.&nbsp; Their twinkle is gone &#8212; his gaze is
  unwavering.&nbsp; But, deep beneath its open appraisal, dwells confusion, hurt, and pain &#8212; a longing for returned innocence.
</p>
<p>
  After months at war, your boy's grown older than you.&nbsp; He's lived with death chasing him&hellip;&nbsp; Usually, on the roadside and/or on the path of a
  local village.&nbsp; How many improvised explosive devices have killed his buddies?&nbsp; Those buddies became closer to him than you, his own Dad.
</p>
<p>
  Alhough he's happy to see you, his heart yearns for those left behind &#8212; for the adrenalin rush, for the heart-pounding fear &#8212; for the ecstasy of
  mutual relief, when they beat death together, one more time.&nbsp; Even what he smells has changed.&nbsp; Every new scent's tainted with his memory of reeking
  cordite, burnt flesh, gas fumes, and/or the stench of spewed guts.
</p>
<p>
  For that moment, he's vulnerable.&nbsp; He lets you see into him, and then, the impact of seeing you again strikes him.&nbsp; He sees how you've changed, and
  aged, worrying about him.&nbsp; Mentally, he pulls a mask over his need for comfort, to protect you from all that he's seen and what he's become.&nbsp; To
  defend and protect.&nbsp; Who better than the ones whom he loves?
</p>
<p>
  He shakes off the sudden sense of discomfort and uncertainty.&nbsp; He says to himself, &quot;I'm home.&nbsp; Everything will be fine&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  And now, the estranged tap dancing around each other begins.
