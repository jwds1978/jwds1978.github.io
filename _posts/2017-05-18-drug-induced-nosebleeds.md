<p>
  I've been noticing myself having &#8212; more and more frequently &#8212; nosebleeds as of late.&nbsp; So, I decided to do some research of my own into
  it.&nbsp; While I'm going to follow-up with a doctor later in the week at an appointment I'd already had for something else, from what I've found in my
  search, the amount and/or types of medications that I'm on may be causing my nosebleeds.&nbsp; Although some of them are minor, some are absolute gushers.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  60% of all people that've had at least one nosebleed in teir life and 6% of nosebleed patients seek medical treatment.&nbsp; Some nosebleeds are caused by
  medications.&nbsp; In a study of 281 patients with nosebleeds (i.e. epistaxis) who sought treatment at a Nova Scotia emergency room, from 2005&#8211;2006,
  researchers found that 41% had taken one or more anticoagulant drugs.

  Allergy and Cold Medications

<p>
  Medications taken to treat allergies and/or colds may dry-out the nose, causing it to bleed.&nbsp; In addition, over-the-counter nasal inhalers may also lead
  to epistaxis &#8212; according to the Cigna Web site on nosebleeds.

  Anticoagulants

<p>
  Field and Nash studied medications taken by their subjects, including acetylsalicylic acid (i.e. ASA) also commonly known as aspirin, clopidogrel (i.e. Plavix)
  and warfarin, or Coumadin, as well as a combination of ASA and clopidogrel or ASA and warfarin.
</p>
<p>
  The results of their study, published in the November 2008 issue of the &quot;Israeli Journal of Emergency Medicine&qut;, showed that 16% of the ASA-only
  group had nosebleeds, followed by 13% of the warfarin-only group, and 7% of the combination ASA and warfarin group.&nbsp; Of those admitted to the hospital,
  50% weren't taking anticoagulants.&nbsp; Of the 50% taking blood thinners, 19% were taking warfarin, and another 19% were taking ASA.&nbsp; 4% each were
  taking ASA and warfarin, the combination of ASA and clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone.
</p>
<p>
  Field and Nash found that the average age of those taking blood thinners was 75&frac12; years compared with 56&#8531; years for non-drug subjects.
</p>
<p>
  In a study in Switzerland, by University of Zurich medical professor Michael B. Soyka (M.D.) and colleagues, reported in &quot;The Laryngoscope&quot; in 2009,
  severe nosebleeds correlated with ASA use based on 99 patients hospitalized for at least one day.&nbsp; 30% were taking ASA.

<h3 id="antidepressants">
  Antidepressants
</h3>
<p>
  Some antidepressants may cause nosebleeds.&nbsp; According to Elias A. Khawam (M.D.) and colleagues, in their 2006 article on antidepressant side effects in a
  2006 issue of the &quot;Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine&quot;, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (i.e. SSRI) antidepressants may cause epistaxis
  because they can inhibit blood platelet function.&nbsp; SSRIs may also cause bruising and gastrointestinal bleeding.

  Psychiatrist, Esther Gwinnell (M.D.) in her 2008 book

    The Encyclopedia of Drug Abuse
  </a>&quot;,
  the chronic intranasal abuse of drugs (i.e. cocaine) can lead to nosebleeds.&nbsp; She also notes that cocaine abuse can lead to the loss of the sense of
  smell.

<p>
  Dr. Schlosser says that the use of some alternative remedies may lead to nosebleeds.&nbsp; He noted that ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and garlic sometimes caused
  coagulation delays &#8212; which, may lead to epistaxis.

<h3 id="non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs">
  Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
</h3>
<p>
  According to the Web site provided by Cigna, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. NSAIDs) may lead to nosebleeds.&nbsp; Individuals with frequent
  nosebleeds, who take NSAIDs, should report this adverse effect to their physicians.
