<p>
  Many times, we're reminded of just how lucky and fortunate we are living here &#8212; in Canada.&nbsp; Could you imagine if this was your child, caught-up in
  the middle of a war?
</p>
<p>
  War created by shitty adults who can't get along &#8212; simply put.&nbsp; This video breaks my heart &#8212; as this little boy just sits patiently, waiting
  to be treated for his injuries.
</p>
<p>
  This is the type of fucking shit that's still going on around the world&hellip;&nbsp; And, sadly, it may never see an end either.&nbsp; However, children
  should never have to bear witness to war created by adults.&nbsp; Never take for granted what we have here in Canada.&nbsp; Protect your children, because
  they never signed-up to enter this fucking mess.&nbsp; It's up to us as adults, to find a way to get along with each other.&nbsp; Even, if it's merely a
  select few idiots whom ruin it for many.&nbsp; I can only hope that this little boy, Omran, and his family find a way to safety &#8212; and, that he someday
  grows up to help others who've witnessed war first-hand as a child themselves.&nbsp; Although this little boy will struggle for many years, for what he's
  witnessed and endured during these young years of his life, I can only hope tat he may grow to believe that war will never be the answer.
