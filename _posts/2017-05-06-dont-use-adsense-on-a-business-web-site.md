title: "Don't Use AdSense on a Business Web Site"
---

<p>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-google-adsense" rel="me" title="Google AdSense">Google AdSense</a> is one of the most commonly used advertising
  platforms, today, within the Internet industry &#8212; with millions of publishers world-wide.&nbsp; Almost every Web property &#8212; whether, small or large
  &#8212; is making money online with AdSense.&nbsp; Is your Web property amongst those?
</p>
<p>
  I'd consider AdSense to be &quot;the people's choice&quot; when it comes to the monetization of a Web site.&nbsp; Anybody with a unique and/or interesting Web
  site can join this program.&nbsp; A single click can earn anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars; depending, upon your niche.&nbsp; If you're looking for
  the easiest and the most profitable pay-per-click ad program, then AdSense is the best.
</p>
<p>
  But, wait a minute though!&nbsp; The title of this post says &quot;no AdSense&quot;&nbsp; Read-on to learn why, at times, the best choice isn't putting
  AdSense &#8212; or, any other ad-serving alternative &#8212; on your business Web site.

<p>
  If you're a novice, and you're planning to build your own online business through a blog and/or an online Web store, you probably intend to insert some Google
  ads on your Web site, to start earning a living online.&nbsp; While there's nothing, particulary, wrong with this use of AdSense, there are a few factors that
  you may want to consider prior to plunging into the AdSense-world.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="say-no-to-adsense-for-a-business-web-site">
  Say &quot;No&quot; to AdSense for a Business Web Site
</h3>
<p>
  Allow me to explain the basics of AdSense and why it's the best advertising platform currently available.
</p>
<p>
  AdSense is a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-contextual-advertising" rel="me" title="Contextual advertising">contextual ad network</a>, which means
  that the ads which are displayed upon the Web page are relevant to the content/topic of the page.&nbsp; For example, let's say that you're running a Web
  hosting blog and you're trying to promote your hosting business.&nbsp; To increase your revenue stream, you utilize AdSense.&nbsp; However, instead of
  promoting your own business, you're suddenly inadvertently promoting your direct competitor's similar business &#8212; due to the contextual
  relationship.&nbsp; This happens because most of the AdSense ads shown will be relevant to Web hosting and/or domain related Web sites&hellip;&nbsp; Not only
  your Web hosting and/or domain Web sites!&nbsp; So, for just a few cents &#8212; or, a few dollars, if you're lucky &#8212; you may be sending away a
  prospective client, from your Web site to that of a direct competitor.
</p>
<p>
  This isn't AdSense-specific, but also to other ad networks which also offer contextual advertising.&nbsp; There are other reasons why it's best to not embed
  AdSense nor any other contextual advertisements on your business Web site.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  It Devalues Your Brand
</h4>
<p>
  Starting a blog, or any other type of Web site, is an enticing opportunity to make money from the comfort of your own home.&nbsp; In order to be able to
  remain competitive though, you need to take care of your brand.&nbsp; Online branding's one of the top-most priorities of a good Web master.
</p>
<p>
  When you begin to monetize your Web site, with various types of advertisements, you're also decreasing the value of your own business brand.&nbsp; You're,
  actually, cheapening your brand with every ad unit that you embed upon the Web page(s) of your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  You may have seen company Web sites and/or sports Web sites that are using AdSense within their Web pages.&nbsp; Rather than promoting their own brands,
  they're using AdSense &#8212; unnecessary and somewhat unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Opportunity for Your Competition
</h4>
<p>
  Because AdSense is a contextual program, the ads that it serves are based upon the content of your Web page(s).&nbsp; If your Web site's all about technology,
  cell phones, and/or other cool gadgets &#8212; and, you make use of AdSense &#8212; AdSense will place advertisements, on your Web pages, for products that
  are related to the technology industry and are similar to your own products.&nbsp; Thus, you'll be providing an opportunity for your business competitors to
  leverage their brand using the AdWords program.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, a competitor can leverage themselves by buying sponsored ads using the AdWords system.&nbsp; By optimizing their campaign through keywords, your
  competitor can easily reach your site through AdSense with a lower cost.&nbsp; This could cost you much more revenue than the cents-per-clicks that you'd get
  from AdSense.
</p>
<p>
  You don't have, complete control, over who advertises with AdWords.&nbsp; Something which could, ultimately, hurt your business in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Your Web Visitor Clicking the Advertisements&nbsp; &equiv;&nbsp; Higher Bounce Rate for Your Web Site
</h4>
<p>
  Depending upon your specific configuration, a click on an AdSense ad may open in the same tab/window, not in another Web browser tab/window.&nbsp; If that's
  the case, while the user could relatively easily click the &quot;back&quot; button, the chances of this happening are slim-to-none.
</p>
<p>
  For this reason alone, potentially, every single click could mean a lost visitor wlie using AdSense.&nbsp; Additionally, AdSense ads may confuse your visitors
  if the ads don't blend well enough with your Web site's overall design/theme.&nbsp; Each click means a higher bounce rate for your Web site. &#8212; your
  visitor's actually leaving your Web site once they click an AdSense ad.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  AdSense is a great opportunity for anyone wanting to put up their own Web site and/or blog.&nbsp; However, there are certain boundaries and/or limitations
  that you should be aware of prior to using AdSense as your primary monetization program.&nbsp; I'd suggest, firstly, to build a good reputation and enough
  content on your Web site before you start monetizing it with AdSense or any other method (i.e. affiliate marketing, direct advertising, etc.).&nbsp; This way,
  you can analyze what's the ideal ad program(s) for your particular Web site.
</p>
<p>
  When you create a blog and/or Web site, to promote your online and/or offline business, my advice is to add your own advertising.&nbsp; You'll want to
  advertise your own products and/or services &#8212; driving more traffic to your landing and/or sales Web pages.
</p>
<p>
  At times, it's in your best interest to stop running those few-cent clicks, and target a superior branding and/or reputation of your own business brand.&nbsp;
  If you're a business owner, I'd like to know what kinds of ads you're running on your Web site(s)&hellip;&nbsp; Are you using any contextual ad networks, like
  AdSense or Chitika, or any other direct advertisement program?&nbsp; Have you removed AdSense from your business Web site(s) after reading this article?&nbsp;
