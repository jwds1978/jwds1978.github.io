  I've posted previous articles with some photos showing just how fucked-up my leg is.&nbsp; They're far more detailed and graphic than those within this
  particular post.&nbsp; However, below, find a few photos that I'd taken today.&nbsp; I'm in an excessive amount of pain the last couple of weeks &#8212;
  lack of medical care, living on the street, etc. aggrivating shit.

  While, they're all somewhat blury &#8212; exception being, the last one &#8212; you should, at least, be able to ascertain that there's something not quite
  right going on.&nbsp; The first three images are of my left leg &#8212; front (i.e. knee) view, inner thigh view, and outer thigh view.&nbsp; I'd found it
  rather difficult to get a rear view of my leg.&nbsp; But, for as bad as the rest may appear, the majority of the bleeding and stuff is on the back of my
  leg&hellip;&nbsp; It's, exponentially, worse than the rest of my leg.&nbsp; The last image is of my right foot.&nbsp; I didn't take the sock off for the
  photo, as I didnt have a change of socks or anything on me, and the blood had bonded the sock and my foot together when it dried.
</p>
<p>
  There was a blood blister on my right foot where that blotch is now.&nbsp; However, it has since ruptured &#8212; leaving behind, a Loonie-size hole in my
  foot.&nbsp; My leg, as can be sort of seen in the above photos, is getting rubbed fucking raw by my brace.
</p>
<p>
  My worker needs to unfuck my shit &#8212; and, right fucking quick.&nbsp; I shouldn't be forced to live on th street due to a mother-fucking landlord who has
  a vendetta because they'd thought that I was moving ASAP and wasn't going to tell him.&nbsp; Although I have been looking, and am going to have the doctor
  fill-out the medical portion of the accessible unit portion of the Housing form once I'm able to pay him the fee, I wasn't going to just up-and-leave with no
  damn notice to him.
</p>
<p>
  Let's break this down Barney-style:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      My landlord won't tell my worker that I'm living there until I pay him rent&hellip;&nbsp; He thought that I was leaving ASAP &#8212; and, without any
      notice to him.
    </li>
    <li>
      Seemingly, my worker refuses to release my money to me, pending rental verification from said landlord.
    </li>
    <li>
      As, previously stated, the landlord refuses to acknowledge that I'm still living there without further payment first.&nbsp; And, at this point, I'm now
      technically not living there anyhow.&nbsp; Without being able to pay May's rent, I was put-out&hellip;&nbsp; Being the type of residence, no notice nor
      eviction order was required.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img
        alt="" height="262" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/05/04/all-sorts-of-fucked-up/Salvation-Army_no_262x262.png"
        style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="262" />
      I tried to get a bed at the Salvation Army, for a few days anyhow, while trying to sort-out this clusterfuck that I've found myself in.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      During the intake process, I'm asked about prescription medication.&nbsp; As per
      <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-in-case-of-emergency" rel="me" title="In Case of Emergency">my ICE Web page</a>, I'm on several medications and
      take them several times throughout each day.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      The intake worker, or who-the-fuck-ever she was, told me that I'd need to hand them over to her as they take all medications.&nbsp; At that point, I told
      her that I'd absolutely comply with their rules while I'm within their building, but when leaving the property for the day though, everything that I enter
      with is to leave with me.&nbsp; I'm not a fucking addict, am not there by court order, nor for some addictions counselling shit.&nbsp; I need a bed to
      sleep at night for a few days &#8212; nothing more and nothing less.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      Being a gimp, it's rather unreasonable of them, to expect for me to travel back-and-forth to their building several times each day in order to get my
      pills.&nbsp; I have a difficult enough time, getting around, in general&hellip;&nbsp; Given my current health condition(s), exacerbated by street-living
      and the stress and shit that goes along with it, mobility is fast becoming all but impossible for me.&nbsp; I soldier-on, pushing through it though, as I
      have no other transportation at the moment; giving me no other alternative.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      I was told that the intake was over, and that they'd not give me bed, because I refused to allow them to keep my medications even when I wasn't within
      their facility.&nbsp; Having been abruptly turned-away from the Salvation Army, I had no other place to go.&nbsp; I sought out one of the the only two
      24-hour Tim Hortons in-town which don't close their inside access at 2300&#8211;0000.&nbsp; I slept in a booth-thing, at the Tim Hortons on Barrydowne,
      for a couple of days.&nbsp; Understandably, they weren't overtly impressed by my sleeping inside of their store &#8212; not having enough money to even
      buy a single fucking Timbit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unable to continue sleeping inside of the restaurant, I was forced onto the street.&nbsp; I've been sleeping on the street for the past couple of nights,
      and don't have any particular hope of getting off of the street any time soon either.&nbsp; Last night, I slept on the ground next to The Mission, between
      them and their neighbouring fire station&hellip;&nbsp; I froze my fucking ass off &#8212; not having a sleeping bag or any-damn-thing &#8212; it got down
      to -7&deg;C (19.4&deg;F) overnight.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  That brings us to today.&nbsp; For the foreseeable future, I'll be living outside with no fixed address.&nbsp; Looking at the forecast, it's supposed to be
  -2&deg;C (28.4&deg;F) on Saturday, -4&deg;C (24.8&deg;F) on Sunday, -2&deg;C (28.4&deg;F) on Monday, and down into the negatives a few other days next
  week.&nbsp; With no protection from the elements and on a prolonged basis, that's asking to get sick with pneumonia and/or some other shit, at the
  least.&nbsp; Like, fuck &#8212; snow's being forecast for Sunday!&nbsp; Whiskey &#8212; Tango &#8212; Foxtrot?!?
</p>
<p>
  Tonight, I'm really not sure what I'm going to be doing with myself&hellip;&nbsp; The one-and-only &quot;hostile&quot; in town refuses to allow me a fucking
  bed&hellip;
</p>
