This morning, aroundabout 0730, I experienced discrimination and ignorance like no other.

I walk with a cane, take countless various medications daily for pain management, psych, etc., and have an orthosis that spans near the entire length of my left leg. Given that, I have a hard time getting up-and-down and on-and-off of the toilet. I have some difficulty in bending my left leg and putting weight on it. That knee is extremely unstable&hellip; Hence, my need for the orthosis and possible surgery down the road. If I'm somewhere without accessible facilities, I don't make an issue and do the best that I can with what they have. However, if somewhere does have clearly accessible washroom facilities, I fully expect to be able to use it, without a problem.

The image below is of my *permanent* Accessible Parking Permit:<br />

If you're not familiar with the accessibility laws in Ontario, have a look <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/accessibility-laws" target="_blank" title="Ontario :: Accessibility Laws">here</a>. The laws are pretty clear regarding this sort of thing.

With that said, I was at <a href="http://www.themission.ca" target="_blank" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Elgin Street Mission</a> this morning for breakfast. While there, nature called, and I intended to answer. The door for the accessible washroom was locked. So, I went and asked the staff to open the door for me as I needed to use the washroom. I walked back to the washrooms with the staff. If not mistaken, his name is Jerry.

Jerry proceeds to tell me that I can use the woman's washroom as somebody was in the men's washroom. I, again, reitereated the fact that I need access to the accessible washroom&hellip; I have a disability and need the grab bars and extra space to not fall on my face and/or in the toilet as has almost happeneded there before when I tried to use the much smaller *normal* washroom there. He just shrugs, huffs at me, tells me to use the woman's washroom and/or leave to use a washroom elsewhere.

The image below, clearly, depicts the fact that said washroom is to be an accessible facility:<br />

At this point, I've really got to go and feel like I'm going to shit myself; literally. I follow him back into the main area and ask the other staff to let me in to the washroom as I'm going to shit myself and need to go. They also tell me that they can't let me in&hellip; Apparently, I'm not disabled enough for them, and should essentially leave the premise.

Now, needless to say, I'm fucking pissed off at that point. But, I still have to relieve myself though. So, I hobble on over to Brady Square and use their accessible facilities. All the while, I was just hoping that I'd not shit myself as I'm hobbling as fast as I can to get there.

Once I've defectated, I return to The Mission. By this time, I'm even more pissed off; to say the least. And, I'd think that I should've been. To be honest, if this had happened just a few years ago, before having been medicated for the protection of such fucksticks, I'd not have thought twice about laying him out on-the-spot; don't let the cane fool you&hellip; I may be a gimp, but I'm not a complete invalid just yet.

I express my frustration and anger to yet another staff in the building, and am given the same attitude as from the rest&hellip; Leaving me with the feeling that nobody there gives a fuck about what had happened to me, the complete and utter degredation of myself, and/or the laws regarding accessibilty.

Should you have anything to say, whether bad/good/indifferent, feel free to do so in the comment/discussion area below.
