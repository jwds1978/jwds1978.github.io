<p>
  This morning, around about 0730, I experienced discrimination, ignorance, and utter stupidity&hellip;
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  I walk with a cane, take countless various medications daily for pain management, psych, etc., and have an orthosis that spans near the entire length of my
  left leg.&nbsp; Given that, I have a hard time getting up-and-down and on-and-off of the toilet.&nbsp; I have some difficulty in bending my left leg and
  putting weight on it.&nbsp; That knee is extremely unstable&hellip; Hence, my need for the orthosis and possible surgery down the road. If I'm somewhere
  without accessible facilities, I don't make an issue and do the best that I can with what they have.&nbsp; However, if somewhere does have clearly accessible
  washroom facilities, I fully expect to be able to use it, without a problem.
</p>
<p>
  The image below is of my permanent Accessible Parking Permit:<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <a href="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/02/16/accessibility-at-the-elgin-street-mission/2017-02-16_14-40-10_03-02.jpg" rel="me" target="_blank" title="">

</p>
<p>
  If you're not familiar with the accessibility laws in Ontario, have a look
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-ontario-accessibility-laws" rel="me" title="Ontario :: Accessibility Laws">here</a>.&nbsp; The laws are pretty
  clear regarding this sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
  With that said, I was at
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-elgin-street-mission" rel="me" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Elgin Street Mission</a> this morning for
  breakfast.&nbsp; While there, nature called, and I intended to answer.&nbsp; The door for the accessible washroom was locked.&nbsp; So, I went and asked the
  staff to open the door for me as I needed to use the washroom.&nbsp; I walked back to the washrooms with the staff.&nbsp; We'll call him Raul Bohen.
</p>
<p>
  Raul proceeds to tell me that I can use the woman's washroom as somebody was in the men's washroom.&nbsp; I, again, reitereated the fact that I need access to
  the accessible washroom&hellip;&nbsp; I have a disability and need the grab bars and extra space to not fall on my face and/or in the toilet as has almost
  happeneded there before when I tried to use the much smaller *normal* washroom on a previous occassion.&nbsp; He just shrugs, huffs at me, tells me to use the
  woman's washroom, and/or leave to use a washroom elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  The image below, clearly, depicts the fact that said washroom is to be an accessible facility:<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <a href="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/02/16/accessibility-at-the-elgin-street-mission/2017-02-16_08-11-12_02-03.jpeg" rel="me" target="_blank" title="">
    <img
      alt="" height="540" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/02/16/accessibility-at-the-elgin-street-mission/2017-02-16_08-11-12_360x540.jpg"
      style="border: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="360" />
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  At this point, I've really got to go and feel like I'm about to shit myself &#8212; literally.&nbsp; I follow him back into the main area and ask the other
  staff to let me in to the washroom as I'm going to shit myself and need to go.&nbsp; They also tell me that they can't let me in&hellip;&nbsp; Apparently,
  I'm not disabled enough for them, and should essentially leave the premise.
</p>
<p>
  Now, needless to say, I'm fucking pissed-off at that point.&nbsp; But, I still have to relieve myself though.&nbsp; So, I hobble on over to Tom Davies Centre
  and use their accessible facilities.&nbsp; All the while, I was just hoping that I'd not shit myself as I'm hobbling as fast as I can to get there.
</p>
<p>
  Once I'd defectated, I returned to The Mission.&nbsp; By this time, I'm even more pissed off; to say the least.&nbsp; And, I'd think that I should've
  been.&nbsp; To be honest, if this had happened just a few years ago, before having been medicated for the protection of such fucksticks, I'd not have thought
  twice about laying him out on-the-spot; don't let the cane fool you&hellip;&nbsp; I may be a gimp, but I'm not a complete invalid just yet.
</p>
<p>
  I express my frustration and anger to yet another staff in the building, and am given the same attitude as from the rest&hellip;&nbsp; Leaving me with the
  feeling that nobody there gives a fuck about what had happened to me, the complete and utter degredation of myself, and/or the laws regarding accessibilty.
</p>
<p>
  Below, is an excerpt from
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-about-the-elgin-street-mission" rel="me" title="About :: The Elgin Street Mission">their about Web page</a>.&nbsp;
  Take special note of the text which I've marked.&nbsp; After this morning, I'd have to say, I agree with the marked portion whole-fucking-heartedly.
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-about-the-elgin-street-mission">
    The Elgin Street Mission is a place of refuge for those who need hope, encouragement, nourishment to their bodies and also to their souls.&nbsp; We are here
