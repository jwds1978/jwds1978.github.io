This is what I found this morning&hellip;

The fucking junkies leaving their used and uncapped needles, along with all of the other associated paraphernalia, laying around everyw-fucking-where are
bad enough.&nbsp; But, like, WTF?!?&nbsp; Now, the fucksticks are shitting themselves and leaving their shitty fucking clothes just laying around too?&nbsp;
Not only were there shitty fucking clothes every-fucking-where, but the toilet was full of shit as well.&nbsp; Seemingly, even the simple act of flushing is
too much for some.

This is what I'd found a few mornings ago&hellip;

When I walked in that morning, upon opening the door, the smell damn near made me fucking puke.&nbsp; I've smelled some bad, and unforgettable, things in my
life.&nbsp; However, that was something fucking else altogether.&nbsp; Honestly, I'd have preferred the smell of burning flesh and/or hair over that.&nbsp;
Like, fuck; it was intensely fucking strong&hellip; With the dor having been closed, it just concentrated inside of the washroom.
