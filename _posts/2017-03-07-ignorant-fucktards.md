This is what I found this morning&hellip;

The fucking junkies leaving their used and uncapped needles, along with all of the other associated paraphernalia, laying around every-fucking-where are bad
enough.&nbsp; But, like, WTF?!?&nbsp; Now, the fucksticks are shitting themselves and leaving their shitty fucking clothes just laying around too?&nbsp; Not
only were there shitty fucking clothes every-fucking-where, but the toilet was full of shit as well.&nbsp; Seemingly, even the simple act of flushing is too
much for some.

This is what I'd found a few mornings ago&hellip;

When I'd walked in that morning, upon opening the door, the smell damn near made me fucking puke.&nbsp; I've smelled some bad, and rather unforgettable
regardless of how much you try, things in my life.&nbsp; However, that was something fucking else altogether.&nbsp; Honestly, I'd have preferred the smell
of burning flesh and/or hair over what I'd smelled that fucking morning.&nbsp; Like, fuck; it was intensely fucking strong&hellip; With the door having been
closed, it just concentrated inside of the washroom.
