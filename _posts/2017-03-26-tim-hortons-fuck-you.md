<p>
  So, I was at the above-mentioned Tim Hortons earlier today.&nbsp; I'd spent at least $30 alone (on just myself) at this Tim Hortons this morning; within an
  hour or less of being there.&nbsp; I was relaxing, using the LCBO's Internet, and drinking cofee while waiting for the library up the road the open at noon.
</p>
<!--excerptBreak-->
<p>
  I'm on no less than 9 different drugs&hellip;&nbsp; Each of which, I take several times per day.&nbsp; With that said, I'm somewhat fucked-up at times.&nbsp;
  Additionally, I've recently started on yet another new drug.&nbsp; And, as such, my body's still adjusting to it.
</p>
<p>
  Today's definitely not one of my better days; not in the fucking least.&nbsp; My left knee's swollen like I've got a big-ass fucking grapefruit stuffed in
  there and the associated pain is higher than usual.&nbsp; One of the side effects <sup><a href="#cite-keppra-side-effects" rel="me" title="">2</a></sup> of
  the new drug is drowsiness.&nbsp; Seemingly, it can last throughout the first month of my starting on it&hellip;&nbsp; Yay!
</p>
<p>
  I'd nodded off for, quite literally, 5 minutes; at most.&nbsp; I know this as I'd just happened to look at the time prior to nodding-off and looked again when
  the fucking shitbag woke me up.&nbsp; I woke up to somebody having slammed the table, at which I was seated, very hard.&nbsp; I woke immediately woke up and
  was ready to beat the living fuck out of a mother-fucker.&nbsp; However, I saw it was somebody in a Tim Hortons uniform.&nbsp; So, instead, I relax and just
  stare at him wondering, WTF?!?
</p>
<p>
  He says nothing more than, &quot;you can't sleep here&quot;.&nbsp; Bear in mind, he didn't just say this to me, he fucking yelled it.&nbsp; Not only was his
  tone rather aggressive, he was fucking yelling at me!&nbsp; Seriously, like, what-the-fucking-fuck?!?&nbsp; If he weren't an employee, and just some random
  fuckstick, I'd have not thought twice about laying the fucker out.&nbsp; Before I even had a chance to say anything to him, he just goes off to the back of
  the store&hellip;&nbsp; Uh, WTF just happened?!?
</p>
<p>
  While I don't know this shitbag's name offhand, I've seen him harassing other in there before.&nbsp; For instance, last week, I'd witnessed him actually
  telling a small group of people (i.e. paying customers, as I saw them buy their shit when they came in) who were being quiet and respectful that they weren't
  allowed to play cards in Tim Hortons.&nbsp; He told them that it was against policy and they had to put the playing cards away.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was
  somewhat fucking shocked at the time; and, even now, don't know WTF.&nbsp; I'd asked him at the time just what policy they were in violation of and WTF his
  problem with them was, but he didn't say anything though.&nbsp; He'd just done the same thing as he had this time; went and hid in the back of the fucking
  store.
</p>
<p>
  At this same Tim Hortons, a few years ago, I was sitting with a client.&nbsp; We'd each bought coffee and food.&nbsp; We were reviewing some business
  contracts and shit on my laptop when a staff member came and told us in no uncertain terms that we'd have to leave.&nbsp; Apparently, we'd been there for too
  long and had overstayed our welcome.&nbsp; However, we'd not even been sitting long enough to have finished our fucking coffess.&nbsp; Looking around the
  store at the time, I saw countless people whom were all there prior to either of us arriving, and were still there after we'd left.&nbsp; And, why the fuck is
  it that they weren't told to leave?&nbsp; Should those there before us not have been told to leave prior to we were?&nbsp; Why were they permitted to continue
  to stay even after we'd vacated ourselves?
</p>
<p>
  That location is a drug-infested shithole&hellip;&nbsp; But, sadly, the only location within walking distance of downtown though.&nbsp; Unless you know the
  staff there intimately, as it would seem, you get treated like fucking shit.&nbsp; Was I targeted the way I was this morning due to my having spoken up, to
  that same shitbag, on the behalf of that group of people the other day?&nbsp; While I can't say for certain, what I do know for a fucking fact, is that I've
  witnessed other peoples full-out sleeping and snoring-a-way.&nbsp; These people, in particular, weren't bothered in any way whatsoever; at least, not duing my
  time in th store anyway.&nbsp; Moreover, I've seen a few of these people on different occasions being somewhat friendly-like with the staff.&nbsp; So, take
  that as you will.

  I stumbled upon the video above while searching the InterWeb for other digruntled Tim Hortons customers.&nbsp; In doing so, I came along the Fuck Tim Hortons
  Web site. <sup><a href="#cite-fuck-tim-hortons" rel="me" title="">1</a></sup>
