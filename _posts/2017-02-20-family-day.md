Lest we forget&hellip;

Why is Family Day a holiday, yet Rememberance Day isn't?&nbsp; Today is just another excuse for those in the public sector to not work and a day for people
like me to remember how fucked up their family really is.

I left home when I was 16 years old; never looking back.&nbsp; However, in recent years, I have made overt efforts to reconcile with my family though.&nbsp;
But, now as then, they showed exactly how little they actually care about me&hellip;&nbsp; As in, not in the fucking least.

At this point in my life, I'm done trying.&nbsp; I've long since abandoned all hope for any sort of family reconcile.
