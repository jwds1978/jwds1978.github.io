<p>
  Lest we forget&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  Why is Family Day a holiday, yet Rememberance Day isn't?&nbsp; Today is just another excuse for those in the public sector to not work and a day for people
  like me to remember how fucked up their family really is.

<p>
  I left home when I was 16 years old; never looking back.&nbsp; However, in recent years, I have made overt efforts to reconcile with my family though.&nbsp;
  But, now as then, they showed exactly how little they actually care about me&hellip;&nbsp; As in, not in the fucking least.
</p>
<p>
  At this point in my life, I'm done trying.&nbsp; I've long since abandoned all hope for any sort of family reconcile.
