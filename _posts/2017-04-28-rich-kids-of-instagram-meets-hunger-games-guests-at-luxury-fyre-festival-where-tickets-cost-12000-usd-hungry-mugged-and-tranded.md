title: "'Rich Kids of Instagram Meets Hunger Games': Guests at Luxury Fyre Festival Where Tickets Cost $12,000 USD 'Hungry, Mugged, and Stranded'"

<p>
  It was supposed to be the most glamorous event of the year&hellip;&nbsp; With all the selfie opportunities and flower-crowns that a young, gym-bodied social
  media influencer could dream of.&nbsp; However, Fyre Festival, an elite concert event on a deserted island in the Bahamas &#8212; with tickets priced up to
  $12,000 USD &#8212; has, quickly, turned into a terrifying B-movie.&nbsp; Flocks of Instagram models were forced to seek shelter in an airport, after arriving
  to discover a lack of food, appalling accommodations, feral dogs roaming the grounds, and violent locals.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, social media exploded overnight, with tales of Instagram-filtered terror and disappointment, with beautiful festival-goers arriving on the island
  to discover half-built tents, their luggage being thrown out of the back of a truck, muggers and thieves laying in-wait to steal wallets from trust fund kids,
  unhelpful staff, and &quot;gourmet cuisine&quot; that turned out to be nothing except for ham and cheese sandwiches.

  Reportedly, one woman who paid $10,000 USD for a VIP ticket, left her belongings in a half-erected tent &#8212; only, to have them stolen minutes later.&nbsp;
  &quot;One guy got punched out by security and they took his wallet&quot;, claimed one festival-goer on Reddit.&nbsp; Others, claimed that local residents on
  the island had been assaulting Fyre Festival attendees.

<p>
  The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism today released the following statement on Twitter:<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

  Fyre Festival, is the brain-child of tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland and Noughties rapper, Ja Rule&hellip;&nbsp; Designed as an exotic alternative to
  Coachella, and promoted by a bevy of Instagram-friendly supermodels &#8212; including, Bella Hadid, Chanel Iman, and Emily Ratajkowski.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

    style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  Fyre Media, the company behind the festival, paid celebrity &quot;influencers&quot; to promote the festival across their social media, before an actual
  musical line-up had even been announced.&nbsp; The campaign worked, with the festival selling thousands of tickets to the island event &#8212; described as
  &quot;a cultural moment created from a blend of music, art, and food&quot; &#8212; to be held over two weekends, on the island of Exumas.
</p>
<p>
  There were hints that Fyre Festival was potentially an elaborate scam &#8212; when Blink-182, abruptly, pulled-out of performing &#8212; claiming that they
  were &quot;not confident that we would have what we need to give you the quality of performances we always give fans&quot;.&nbsp; The band was due to perform
  at the festival, alongside of acts such as Disclosure, Major Lazer, Skepta, and members of Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music hip-hop troupe.
</p>
<p>
  While the event continues to be traumatic to the many rich and/or beautiful people, currently seeking shelter in an airport and eager to fly home, social
  media has &#8212; somewhat understandably &#8212; reacted with giggles.

  According to one festival-goer, organisers on the island have handed out sheets of paper, encouraging people to sign it &#8212; in order to get a full refund
  of their tickets.&nbsp; However, the Fyre Festival Web site, states:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-fyre-festival">
    All sales are final.&nbsp; There are no refunds.

  The festival's Instagram account has claimed that they're working to &quot;accommodate guests and deliver a great experience&quot;.&nbsp; They've directed
  festival-goers to an, apparent, safe-zone.
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-things-got-off-to-an-unexpected-start-at-day-one-of-fyre-festival">
    Things got off to an unexpected start at day one of Fyre Festival.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    FOR THOSE CURRENTLY ON GREAT EXUMA<br />
    We are working to comfortably accommodate guests and deliver a great experience.&nbsp; If you have needs, please head to the &quot;BLUE HOUSE&quot; on the
    main festival site.&nbsp; Security, first aid, and Fyre Festival staff are here to assist immediately, 24/7.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    FOR THOSE WITH PENDING TRAVEL TO THE EXUMAS TOMORROW<br />
    Due to circumstances beyond our control, and in line with a culture of safety, all inbound charter flights to the Exumas have been canceled.&nbsp; Your
    ticket and any funds uploaded to your RFID band will be refunded.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Thank you for bearing with us as we work through the growing pains that every first year event experiences.&nbsp; Revised itinerary information will be
    shared soon for the remainder of this weekend and weekend two.
