<p>
  I was talking to one of my recently new friends and she'd expressed a discomfort in approaching me during an event.&nbsp; She wanted to respect my space, but
  didn't know a comfortable way in which to approach me with respect to my PTSD symptoms within a group setting.&nbsp; It made me start to think about the
  intense air that I must emote for her to question when and how to approach me.&nbsp; I like talking to people &#8212; that is, except for the ignorant and/or
  stupid, as I have a zero-tolerance for ignorance and stupidity &#8212; it's where I get some of my greatest inspirations.&nbsp; However, at times, my
  condition may not permit me to interact on a desired level and/or in an expected way.
</p>
<p>
  The PTSD mind sees all of the interactions and people as a possible threat &#8212; even loved ones and friends that we've known for our entire lives.&nbsp;
  In-between events and workshops, I was concentrating heavily on trying to talk to people and maintain my anxiety level, which gets in the way of
  communicating.&nbsp; Internally, we may be caught-up in our inner-world and if we're wrapped-up in states of high emotions, we may be displaying body postures
  and facial expressions that say, &quot;I'm not at home right now &#8212; please, don't leave a message&quot;.&nbsp; Our body language may be misconstrued as
  offensive&hellip;&nbsp; Therefore, subject to misinformation, stereotyping, stigma, and/or personal biases.&nbsp; To the uninitiated in trauma, we may appear
  as someone to wary and/or fear.
</p>
<p>
  A common aspect of our mental wound's the defensive state of mind.&nbsp; When understood, within this context, it may help to facilitate communication.&nbsp;
  If I'm not completely zoned-out, my hyper-vigilance is zapping my energy on purely defensive matters.&nbsp; Whether from fighting my delusions, rendering
  reality obsolete, to dodging my many triggers so that I may not hallucinate.&nbsp; Our triggers are many, and some of us, hallucinate regularly.&nbsp; Please,
  consider this and be respectful.&nbsp; Balance this with knowing that we don't want to be feared and/or treated as though we're broken.&nbsp; This
  inner-battle that we wage is against ourselves, not you.&nbsp; You'd be safer, standing next to a combat veteran with PTSD, than most people.&nbsp; When our
  symptoms manifest, try not to take it personally, and see it as a learning opportunity.&nbsp; It's easier to accept the pain and discomfort of a veteran
  that's been wounded from a bullet or a bomb, and much more difficult to see our mental wound and difficulties in interacting, as our scars.
</p>
<p>
  I've met some other combat veterans with some intense stares &#8212; some, fairly recently.&nbsp; But the funny thing, is one of the most intense looking
  guys, has a wicked sense of humour and a huge heart.&nbsp; No, not me&hellip;&nbsp; However, I was having the same trouble as my new friend though.&nbsp; How
  to approach an intense looking combat veteran?&nbsp; I'd imagine that my new friend would also be thinking, &quot;what do I do if he begins to share some of
  his burdens&quot;.&nbsp; A veteran's sharing, lightens their burden, and extends a unique opportunity and honour to the recipient.&nbsp; Less than 14% of our
  nation has served our country in the military, and when we opt to open up, our voices should resound.&nbsp; I'm starved of human interaction due to my
  super-hero ability to run people off, who have little understanding of my condition.&nbsp; Sharing nurtures the healing process, soothing the mental wound,
  filling me with empathy.&nbsp; Even though I resist talking about my experiences, I feel compelled to share anyhow.
</p>
<p>
  I'm willing to expound upon on my condition and life, but many veterans don't feel comfortable discussing their experiences and wounds &#8212; mental or
  otherwise.&nbsp; If you want to approach a veteran, and they have a flat affect &#8212; as the textbooks like to call it &#8212; assess the situation.&nbsp;
  That's what we're doing during those intensely long pauses &#8212; you may as well do the same.&nbsp; Do we wear military fatigues, insignia, and/or
  medals?&nbsp; Do we appear anxious, guarded, and/or rigid?&nbsp; How about spring-loaded?&nbsp; What's that all about?&nbsp; Unresolved trauma becomes locked
  within the body, giving our posture the appearance of aggression and/or overly assertiveness&hellip;&nbsp; Thus, reinforcing the stereotype.
</p>
<p>
  If you were to notice my hearing aids, I'd be comfortable with questions on how it would be best to communicate with me, concerning my hearing.&nbsp; I have a
  bilateral hearing loss, and being able to see the lips move, allows for better hearing.&nbsp; This could be a possible segue into how I lost my hearing
  &#8212; which, I'd tell you was from enemy artillery.&nbsp; I'm not suggesting that asking a veteran about how they got a prosthetic limb's a good idea
  &#8212; that may be akin to asking about their sex life.&nbsp; Never, ask a veteran if they've killed someone.&nbsp; You may as well say, &quot;Hi!&nbsp; I
  don't know you, but would you completely bare your soul to me here and now&quot.&nbsp; It's rather rude and completely disrespectful.&nbsp; But, asking a
  warrior about a pin they're wearing, may be a good way to see if they're open to sharing though.
</p>
<p>
  Many veterans are open to sharing about their military experience.&nbsp; It wasn't all bad, and in many ways, better than today.&nbsp; If we're approached
  with respect, and treated with dignity, we may impart upon a part of our nation's living oral history.&nbsp; Who knows, you may become a member of their
  trusted inner-circle &#8212; their squad at home.
