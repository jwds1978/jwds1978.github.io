  The military has a way of boiling everything down to its most eloquent and basic foundation.&nbsp; They teach newcomers to embrace, what they refer to as,
  &quot;<a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-embrace-the-suck-james-w-d-stewart" rel="me" title="Embrace 'The Suck' :: James W.D. Stewart">the suck</a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  It's that threshold where your body breaks down and <a

    title="7 Things Destroying Your Mental Energy :: Blog :: James W.D. Stewart">your mind takes over</a>.&nbsp; If you're weak-minded and ready to quit, your
  body will follow suit.&nbsp; If you're expecting &quot;the suck&quot;, then you welcome it &#8212; even, embrace it.&nbsp; You won't succumb to it &#8212; you
  push yourself through it.

  Here are 5 steps for embracing &quot;the suck&quot;:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Work on yourself.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Ignore what everyone else is doing.&nbsp; I mean this &#8212; everyone.&nbsp; Stop paying attention to your competition.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Stop reading their press.&nbsp; Stop visiting their social media accounts.&nbsp; They're only going to share the good stuff.&nbsp; There's nothing
          there to feed the fire in your belly &#8212; only, seeds of darkness.&nbsp; Those seeds will fester into self-doubt.&nbsp; The self-doubt will bleed
          into anxiety.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Focus on you.&nbsp; Focus on good things that you can do &#8212; and, move forward with them.&nbsp; If you can focus on yourself, you'll stoke the
          flame that's inside of you.&nbsp; That fire will ignite your self-confidence.&nbsp; Self-confidence will explode into impenetrable charisma and power.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Chip away at it.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          In CrossFit, there are workouts called &quot;chippers&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; I love them, and at the same time, I hate them.&nbsp; Most CrossFitters will
          tell you the same thing.&nbsp; It's because they push you into &quot;the suck&quot; and they keep you there.&nbsp; You just have to chip away.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Usually, for a duration &#8212; which, seems like an eternity.&nbsp; The advice from coaches?&nbsp; Just keep moving.&nbsp; You need to chip
          away.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Step by step&hellip;&nbsp; A small win, by small win, but keep moving forward though &#8212; chip away.&nbsp; If you commit to something and execute
          steps toward that thing, you'll win.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a routine.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          When you're on your knees, you can default to the routine&hellip;&nbsp; It will pull you along for the ride.&nbsp; Routine will set your
          rails&hellip;&nbsp; Keeping you moving in the right direction.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you know that you go to bed at a certain time every night, subconsciously, your body will begin to shut-down at the same time every night.&nbsp; If
          you work-out at the same time daily, your body will begin to crave the endorphins at the same time every day.&nbsp; If you slip into deep work-flow,
          under the same circumstances each day &#8212; day-in and day-out &#8212; it will be easy.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Set your routine.&nbsp; So, if the ground's slick and you lose traction, the rails will keep in-center and moving forward.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't track a damn thing.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Working on you, chipping away, and creating a routine aren't the same as succeeding.&nbsp; They're the steps on the road to success that you shouldn't
          judge.&nbsp; Allow yourself to resist tracking everything.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We're all a bit obsessed with tracking things.&nbsp; Our steps&hellip;&nbsp; Our sleep&hellip;&nbsp; Even, meditation.&nbsp; All great ways to effect
          change, but if you want to get tough-as-nails though, you need to just &quot;do&quot;.&nbsp; Stop tracking &#8212; and, just do&hellip;&nbsp; Every
          day&hellip;&nbsp; No matter what.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you mess up, stop.&nbsp; Then, get back to it.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          No looking back&hellip;&nbsp; Don't over analyze.&nbsp; Just hit the reset button and get at it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
