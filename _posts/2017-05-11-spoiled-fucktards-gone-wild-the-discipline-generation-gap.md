<p>
  An ever-increasing lack of authority has bred, as a leading psychologist forewarned, a &quot;spoilt generation&quot; of children who believe that grown-ups
  must earn their respect.&nbsp; Aric Sigman's research shows, the rise of the &quot;little emperor&quot; spans the class divide and is fuelling ills from
  childhood obesity to teenage pregnancy.&nbsp; Attempts to &quot;empower&quot; children, and a lack of discipline in the classroom, have also fostered rising
  levels of violence &#8212; at home, at school, and in the street.
</p>
<p>
  <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sigman, a fellow of the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-royal-society-of-medicine" rel="me"
    title="The Royal Society of Medicine">Royal Society of Medicine</a>, said that nursery-age children are becoming increasingly violent and disrespectful
  towards their teachers &#8212; &quot;parent battering&quot; is on the rise &#8212; and the number of policemen attacked by children is soaring.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sigman, said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    Authority is a basic health requirement in children's lives.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Children of the spoilt generation are used to having their demands met by their parents and others in authority, and that in-turn, makes them unprepared for
    the realities of adult life.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This has consequences in every area of society, from the classroom to the workplace, the streets to the criminal courts, and rehabilitation clinics.&nbsp;
    Being spoilt is now classless &#8212; from aristocracy to underclass, children are now spoilt in ways that go far beyond materialism.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This is partly the result of an inability to distinguish between being authoritative versus authoritarian, leaving concepts such as authority and boundaries
    blurred.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    And, the consequences are measurable &#8212; Britain now has the highest rates of child depression, child-on-child murder, underage pregnancy, obesity,
    violent and anti-social behaviour and pre-teen alcoholism &#8212; since records began.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  For his report, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation" rel="me" title="The Spoilt Generation">The Spoilt Generation</a>, he drew on
  150 studies and reports, including official figures on crime and data on parenting strategies.&nbsp; Taken together, they showed many of the problems
  blighting &quot;broken Britain&quot; are linked to a lack of discipline.&nbsp; This is being exacerbated by misguided attempts to give children more control
  over their lives.
</p>
<img

  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="468" />
<p>
  <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sigman says that youngsters' inflated sense of their own importance is fuelling the obesity epidemic.&nbsp; Children feel that
  they have the right to demand foods which would once have been given as an occasional treat.&nbsp; He suggests, that some children thought to have attention
  deficit hyperactivity disorder, might simply have never learned how to behave.&nbsp; Calling for &quot;commonsense policies&quot; to put children in their
  place, <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sigman said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    There should be an absolute presumption both in law and in policy that adults &quot;know better&quot; and are in the right unless there are exceptional
    reasons.&nbsp; Teachers' authority has been vastly weakened legally, professionally and culturally.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    There should be a presumption that teachers &quot;know better&quot; and are in the right, unless it is shown otherwise.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  He also believes that fathers should have more access to their children following separation and/or divorce.
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-spoilt-generation">
    Separated fathers must be legally recognised as being of paramount importance.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  His views were echoed by experts in health and childcare.&nbsp; Michele Elliott, of the children's charity Kidscape, said:
  <blockquote>
    Children no longer have boundaries.&nbsp; It's bad for children and it's bad for parents.&nbsp; Some parents, due to a lack of time, pressures at work and
    so forth, are trying to buy their children's love, which is toxic.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They feel guilty for not being around as often so when their children ask for things they simply say &quot;yes&quot; to compensate.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Professor Cary Cooper, head of psychology and health at Lancaster University, said long working-hours had taken a terrible toll on families.
  <blockquote>
    As a result parents cannot invest the time in their kids that they should.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    With their parents out to work all the time the children are turning to their peer groups to provide them with the family they need.&nbsp; We have been more
    concerned with becoming an affluent, successful country at the expense of investing in our family and our children.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Tim Loughton, Tory children's spokesman, said:
  <blockquote>
    We believe that parents should be taking a greater responsibility for their children and that teachers and other figures in authority should be able to
    exercise their powers when the parameters are broken.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  He said that the Conservatives were devising a National Citizens' Service for all 16-year-olds, giving them the chance to go on a summer challenge &#8212;
  involving outward-bound, team building, and community engagement work.&nbsp; A Department for Children, Schools and Families spokesman said:
  <blockquote>
    It's pathetic to knock a whole generation of young people through sweeping generalisations.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The vast majority of young people play positive roles in their communities, do well at school and are a credit to their families and themselves.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Parents, not politicians, bring up children.&nbsp; We've given police and teachers the tough powers they've asked for to deal with anti-social behaviour,
    criminal activity and poor discipline by the small minority.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    We help parents that need the most support through Family Intervention Partnerships.&nbsp; Standards have never been higher in school and there has been
    massive investment in youth facilities and activities outside the classroom.&nbsp; Teenage conceptions are falling and fewer young people are drinking
    alcohol or taking drugs.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Ministers are clear that this should be the best country in the world for children to live &#8212; but we know there is more to do and have never made any
    bones about it.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Just the other day, on the news, I saw a report about how everyone's up in arms that our schools are failing our kids.&nbsp; Teacher shortages, lack of
  budgeting, and students not being prepared for higher education &#8212; let alone, the world.&nbsp; But, has it yet dawned on you that we're failing our
  teachers?
</p>
<p>
  Things are very different now than from when I was growing up.&nbsp; We were raised to have manners, be respectful, listen to our teachers, and do the best
  work that we could.&nbsp; We feared the paddle in school and actually had consequences when we got home.&nbsp; Our parents sat down with us and helped us with
  our homework.&nbsp; If there was a problem at school, they went in and talked to the teacher.&nbsp; But, most of all, they raised us to adhere to the Golden
  Rule of conduct.
</p>
<p>
  But, today it's quite different though.&nbsp; Early childhood teachers are expected to raise the children in their care.&nbsp; The way children are treated
  today's detrimental to them and to the teachers in their profession.&nbsp; They're either being spoiled beyond belief or they get absolutely no attention at
  home.&nbsp; Therefore, they feel that they're entitled to everything they want and/or are constantly acting out to get the attention that they crave.&nbsp;
  This, and many other issues, are starting younger and younger.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="not-working-on-potty-training">
  Not Working on Potty Training
</h3>
<p>
  There's nothing more irritating than trying to potty train a child during the week and have it all fail over the weekend.&nbsp; It's a parent's job to work
  with the child at home and in partnership with the teacher during the week.&nbsp; Everyone should be on the same page about how training in each atmosphere
  &#8212; school and home &#8212; will be handled.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="excessive-spoiling">
  Excessive Spoiling
</h3>
<p>
  By doing this, you're teaching your children that they're entitled to everything that they want.&nbsp; Even at a young age, children in this atmosphere are
  whiney, mouthy, and mean spirited.&nbsp; Due to the sphere of influence, they teach other children by their actions, that it's OK to act in such a
  manner&hellip;&nbsp; That it's also OK to act any way they want.&nbsp; By allowing your children to behave in this way, you're failing your child's educators.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="babying-them">
  Babying Them
</h3>
<p>
  I understand that you need to love on your child and do things for them at times.&nbsp; However, when you baby them to the extent that they can't do anything
  for themselves, it makes it hard on teachers in the classroom.&nbsp; I've seen two year olds that don't eat solid foods because they don't know how to
  chew.&nbsp; Their parents don't sit down and work with them.&nbsp; I've seen six and seven year olds who can't tie their shoes and/or button their pants.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-interest-in-their-learning">
  Lack of Interest in Their Learning
</h3>
<p>
  When I was growing up, my parents worked with me on the things that I was having trouble with.&nbsp; I see five year olds who don't know their shapes,
  numbers, and/or colours.&nbsp; When teachers inform parents of these issues, they get many varied responses&hellip;&nbsp; From total disinterest, to excuses,
  to smirks and laughter.&nbsp; It's as if no one cares.&nbsp; It's not their sole responsibility to teach your child the things that they need to know.&nbsp;
  You need to work with them &#8212; and the teachers &#8212; too.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-interest-in-their-child-period">
  Lack of Interest in Their Child &#8212; Period
</h3>
<p>
  I see so many parents on cell phones at pick-up time.&nbsp; Between snippets of conversation, they're telling their children to get ready-to-go.&nbsp; This,
  is heartbreaking.&nbsp; You've been apart from them all day and can't spare five minutes to ask them how their day was?&nbsp; Although, this is a small
  example, it explains why some of the children are stuck like glue to the teacher all day.&nbsp; They don't get enough attention at home so they'll do anything
  at school to get attention of any kind.&nbsp; Some kids are glued to them at the hip, while others act-out.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="not-allowing-teachers-to-discipline">
  Not Allowing Teachers to Discipline
</h3>
<p>
  I've come across parents who don't want their children to be put in time-out and/or disciplined.&nbsp; In their eyes, their children are &quot;just
  babies&quot; and don't know right from wrong.&nbsp; This is, regardless, that the children are ages two and five.&nbsp; This request makes handling a
  classroom of sixteen to twenty, especially, difficult.&nbsp; The child knows that there are no consequences at home nor school.&nbsp; So, they'll be defiant
  and get in trouble.&nbsp; This, in-turn, encourages their classmates to act the same way.&nbsp; It also puts a strain on teachers.&nbsp; They spend more time
  managing those who act-out than they do teaching and preparing children to be successful.&nbsp; They're supposed to be teaching them necessary skills.&nbsp;
  The fact that they have to constantly stop what they're doing's a disservice to the children, themselves, and to the future of our society.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  All of these examples and scenarios lead to chaos and great frustration in the classroom.&nbsp; Don't misunderstand, teachers love your children and want to
  see them grow, be happy, and be successful.&nbsp; However, they strongly need for the parents to step-up and support them and the purpose of their job.&nbsp;
  If we all work together, classrooms will run smoother, our children will be happier and ready-to-learn, and we can all thrive.

  Recently, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-what-makes-great-teaching" rel="me" title="What makes great teaching?">a research centre in the United
  Kingdom</a> found that lavishing praise upon students &#8212; particularly, low-attaining students &#8212; may be counter-productive.&nbsp; By providing a
  no-consequence/no-failure environment, in which the top priority's to make everybody feel good about themselves, we're doing little more than setting young
  people up to fail.
</p>
<p>
  It would appear that our modern education systems have delivered us not only a <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-australias-students-slide-in-international-rankings" rel="me"
    title="Australia's students slide in international rankings">back-slide of Australian student rankings</a>, but also the highest youth unemployment rate in
  decades.&nbsp; Research suggests that basic employability skills &#8212; where the worker can arrive on time, take instruction, and get along with others
  &#8212; <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-australian-youth-unemployment-2014-snapshot" rel="me" title="Australian youth unemployment 2014: snapshot">are
  wanting in this generation of young people</a>.
</p>
<p>
  An advertisement for an apprentice, recently posted on a job Web site, perfectly summarized the difficulty faced by employers trying to give a young person a
  go.&nbsp; It listed only two selection criteria:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Can turn-up Monday through Friday.
    </li>
    <li>
      Not afraid to work.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  The stories that came my way shared a common history&hellip;&nbsp; Early-on, in the training path of some young people, there can be a total disconnect
  between the individual's assessment of their strengths and weaknesses as compared to everyone else's.
</p>
<p>
  This isn't anything new.&nbsp; Typically, coined &quot;poor insight&quot;, there's a raft of research including the aptly named <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-why-the-unskilled-are-unaware-further-explorations-of-absent-self-insight-among-the-incompetent" rel="me"
    title="Why the Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-Insight Among the Incompetent">Why the Unskilled are Unaware</a> that
  demonstrates the cognitive mechanisms at fault here &#8212; or, more simply put, why stupid people don't know that they're stupid.
</p>
<p>
  But, what happens when this person hits your training environment?&nbsp; What's the education system's role, responsibility, and/or duty of care &#8212; and,
  to whom &#8212; in this situation?
</p>

<p>
  Sadly, our modern education system's become complicit in the <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-careers-advice-system-failing-australian-schoolchildren-says-national-centre-for-vocational-education-and-research-study"
    rel="me" title="Careers advice system failing Australian schoolchildren, says National Centre for Vocational Education and Research study">business of
    manufacturing aspirations</a>, no matter how delusional.&nbsp; This is facilitated by the <a

</p>
<p>
  This has left teaching staff too terrified to have conversations with students as to whether they're suited to their chosen career path, or at genuine risk of

<p>
  Here are a couple of examples:
  <ul>
    <li>
      TAFE trainee X was capable of doing the tasks required of him.&nbsp; However, he had a habit of proffering potentially dangerous advice to clients outside
      of his training &#8212; despite being been told not to do this.&nbsp; His placement took to hiding the phone from him.&nbsp; He also over-shared gruesome
      details of his chaotic personal life to stunned clients.&nbsp; Trainee X was convinced that he'd be offered employment, at the end of his stint, although
      his placement told him not to expect this &#8212; privately, labelling him &quot;a disaster&quot; and &quot;unemployable&quot;.
    </li>
    <li>
      University student Y committed a serious, immoral, and (un)professional foul during a work placement &#8212; raising serious concerns, regarding her

  Consider also, the impact of the various get-out-of-jail-free cards &#8212; appeals, exam re-sits, extensions, supplementary assessments &#8212; available to
  students in the case of poor performance, shambolic time-management, and/or concerning interpersonal behaviours (i.e. lack of initiative, poor team skills,
  poorly developed ethics, unadaptable to change, etc.).&nbsp; Would these be available in the work place?

  their strengths, while reflecting upon their weaknesses &#8212; to change any counter-productive attitudes/behaviours and/or redirect their efforts into a
  more suitable career course.

<p>
  The solution, requires a shift in attitude from educational organisations, students &#8212; and, <a
