<p>
  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a, debilitating and life changing, mental wound commonly associated with veterans experiencing trauma during
  war-time.&nbsp; Studies by the government have revealed <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> isn't limited to combat, it also includes
  childhood abuse, military rape, and reckless behaviour.&nbsp; <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> is considered a disorder to most
  professionals as well as the government.&nbsp; <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> is a natural response by the human brain to inoculate
  against further trauma.&nbsp; Within this post, I'll compare and contrast studies completed by the government on the efficacy of CAM (Complementary and
  Alternative Medicine) and western medicine used to treat <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> and why the &quot;D&quot; should be dropped.
</p>
<p>
  When a soldier comes home, they're given a mental examination.&nbsp; If they're considered to be unfit for duty, the military will tag them with a <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> label &#8212; a polite way of saying that they're no longer mission-capable.&nbsp; If the soldier's been
  in a firefight, the examination may happen in-country.&nbsp; If a soldier admits that they're experiencing trauma, from witnessing a friend step on a
  landmine, the examiner may deem the soldier as unfit for duty &#8212; discharging them.&nbsp; Most soldiers won't admit it, and with the possibility of losing
  careers plus its stigma, soldiers will alienate from most brothers-in-arms.&nbsp; To be deemed no longer mission-capable creates animosity, hatred, and
  mistrust.&nbsp; Ridiculed and removed from the brotherhood, the soldier almost always slips into depression, and can eventually lead to suicide.&nbsp; A
  shocking 22 veterans commit suicide every day.&nbsp; It sickens me, to think that a soldier doing his job will feel the need to commit suicide, due to hazing
  from an egotistical and testosterone-driven system.

<p>
  The government uses Sertaline &#8212; namely, Zoloft &#8212; to treat <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr>, commonly.&nbsp; However, a double-blind
  study done on wounded veterans, showed that only 41% of veterans displayed reduced symptoms and that 33% had reduced symptoms using the placebo.&nbsp; It can
  help by repressing the emotions, aiding the mind's ability to process trauma, and enable the confidence that it can be healed.&nbsp; Government reports on the
  efficacy of <abbr title="Complementary and Alternative Medicine">CAM</abbr> can be life-changing.&nbsp; However, after 6 weeks of mantra repetition during
  90-minute sessions, can send <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> into a full remission.&nbsp; Acupuncture, progressive muscle relaxation, and
  transcendental meditation also help veterans according to the government.&nbsp; The stigma placed on <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> makes our
  soldiers and veterans feel weak &#8212; experiencing this, impedes daily life activities, further deepening depression and increasing the risk of
  suicide.&nbsp; If we teach that <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> is a mental wound and just as much a part of life, as common as a fractured
  arm, or a deep cut&hellip;&nbsp; If we revise the standards by dropping the &quot;D&quot; and call it <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> rather than <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>&hellip;&nbsp; Those recovering from trauma,
  could have a more acceptable identity, and be more open to getting the proper care that they so desperately need.
</p>
<p>
  By renaming the mental wound to <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr>, it would reduce the impacts on soldiers lives who've received a mental injury
  due to trauma.&nbsp; The risks of losing your career could be reduced significantly, as fewer soldiers would be identified as insane, drastically reducing the
  personality changes and inner-suffering.&nbsp; If we reframe trauma as a natural process &#8212; a common reaction to traumatization &#8212; it could change
  many lives, of our friends and families, that might otherwise commit suicide.
</p>
<p>
  To bring down the suicide rates in returning veterans, and the internal suffering, we need to look at trauma differently.&nbsp; The stigma attached that
  &quot;you're no longer good enough&quot; is archaic &#8212; the Spartans would exile those deemed to be unworthy.&nbsp; Soldiers are taught that <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> is a wound caused by not being strong enough to deal with the traumas of combat.&nbsp; They're taught that the
  condition is life-threatening and that <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> will cause them to appear weaker than their peers.&nbsp; However, the
  fact that they're standing after combat's a testament to their true inner-strength.&nbsp; The &quot;warriors only&quot; mentality is detrimental, and out of
  place, with the advances of today.&nbsp; We, as a society, are evolving towards <abbr title="Complementary and Alternative Medicine">CAM</abbr> and more
  worldly types of treatments.&nbsp; In one study, elder veterans from the Vietnam-era accepted and agreed that mindfulness and meditation techniques used for
  centuries in eastern medicine and in <abbr title="Complementary and Alternative Medicine">CAM</abbr>, are beneficial to recovery from <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
  <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> is a common part of life &#8212; recovery is possible.&nbsp; When we correctly frame in the name and the way in
  which we perceive trauma &#8212; a direct challenge to western medicine's assumption that <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> is a
  life-debilitating disorder&hellip;&nbsp; It's a natural response within the brain to prevent further damage, and when injured, the individual's in-need of
  treatment.&nbsp; A more useful way to prevent suicide, and inner-suffering, is teaching that <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> is a natural
  reaction to overwhelming events.&nbsp; Then, set an action plan, rather than casting them aside&hellip;&nbsp; We need to understand that the veteran's trained
  that they're no longer &quot;good enough&quot;.&nbsp; That way, we can regulate with verbiage, some of the inner-issues which they're having as well as our
  common treatment etiquette.&nbsp; The way in which we talk to a veteran with <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress">PTS</abbr> should be in a way that doesn't
  offend them &#8212; never, ask a veteran, if they've killed someone.&nbsp; Approach them, with same regard in any sensitive topic, with respect to their
  circumstances and cultural sensitivities.&nbsp; Dropping the &quot;D&quot;, would foster a new mission of unifying the mind, by imparting empathy in the
  naming of our condition for those who've lived through extraordinary situations affecting our communities.&nbsp; The next time that you see a <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> victim, treat them normally &#8212; with acceptance and respect &#8212; dropping the &quot;D&quot;.
