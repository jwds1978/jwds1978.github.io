  While I've not ever personally been subject to nor witness of so-called 'bumping' from a flight, I've always been of the opinion that it's a totally fucked-up
  policy that should be illegal.&nbsp; If other sectors were to try and do as much, they'd be hit with charges (i.e. bait-and-switch, fraud, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  Quite simply, while an airline should be able to ask for a passenger to give up their seat, they shoudn't have any authority to forcibly remove them should
  they choose not to.&nbsp; They did pay for said seat afterall&hellip;&nbsp; It's not like they were given the seat, initially, for free to begin with.&nbsp;
  They paid for a service and, rightfully so, expected for said service to be rendered.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Airlines are given way too fucking much authority.&nbsp; The passenger wasn't being beligerant&hellip;&nbsp; He was simply expecting to be flown to where he'd
  paid for them to fly him to.&nbsp; He was being removed for being a security threat&hellip;&nbsp; He was removed to make room for United staff.&nbsp; An
  airline supervisor walked onto the plane and brusquely announced:
  <blockquote>
    We have United employees that need to fly to Louisville tonight.&nbsp; &hellip;&nbsp; This flight's not leaving until four people get off.
  </blockquote>
  &nbsp;<br />
  Fuck that shit&hellip;&nbsp; You don't demand that paying customers get the fuck out to make room for employees.&nbsp; That's just common-fucking-sense.
</p>
<p>
  Below, is a video of the man being dragged out of his seat on a United Airlines flight.&nbsp; The incident has sparked a social media uproar.&nbsp; The airline
  insisted the flight was over-booked and that it had no choice except to contact authorities when the man refused to leave.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

  &nbsp;<br />
  Look at his, quite literally, bloody face.&nbsp; They physically assaulted this man, who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing wrong.&nbsp; And, they will more than
  likely get away with their actions.
</p>
<p>
  Seemingly, given the social outrage over the incident, there are politicians within the US who are calling for congressional hearings.&nbsp; While that's all
  well and good, I'd not hold my breath waiting for anything to change anytime soon though.&nbsp; With that said, although there's not likely to be a short-term
  resolution, perhaps there will one day be a long-term solution.&nbsp; Airlines must be held accountable for their actions and the actions of those in their
  employ.
</p>
<p>
  To be quite honest, had I been on that particular flight and witnessed this happening, I'd not have sat idle while they dragged him from his
  seat&hellip;&nbsp; They would've needed a small army to remove him, after getting through me.&nbsp; I may be a partial gimp nowadays, but make no mistake, I'm
  a warrior to the death and beyond.
</p>
<p>
  I'll always stand-up for, and to protect, those who may be unable to do so for themselves.&nbsp; The look on the man's broken and bloody face, and within his
  eyes, is that of shear and utter terror; he's, quite clearly, absolutely terrified.&nbsp; WTF gives an airline the right to brutally assault, a paying
  customer who is of no threat or disturbance to anybody else, because of their own fucking incompetence?
