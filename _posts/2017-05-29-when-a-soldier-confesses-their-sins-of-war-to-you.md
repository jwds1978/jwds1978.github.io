<p>
  By listening without judgment and negativity, you're giving the soldier/veteran something extremely valuable.&nbsp; It may seem insignificant &#8212; they're
  pouring out their soul to you, and in doing so, you can have a unique opportunity to help them reclaim what they lost on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
  Living &#8212; surviving &#8212; through combat changes who we were.&nbsp; We may choose to remain in denial, because if we can pretend to be who we were,
  then we may not have to face who we've undoubtedly become.
</p>
<p>
  The soldier/veteran's chosen to look into their soul and share with you.&nbsp; When they delve into this abyss, they experience it for the first time, as well
  as you.&nbsp; In combat, we have to compartmentalize all of the horrors of war, due to our inability to process it &#8212; to do otherwise, would get us
  killed.
</p>

<p>
  By listening and giving them comfort, they can begin to regain that part of the mind that's been ravaged by war.&nbsp; They aren't necessarily proud of some
  of the things which they'll share with you.&nbsp; Don't tell them that you're proud of them, in these moments, for this is a judgment.&nbsp; Deep down, they
  know that it's not their fault &#8212; this to, is a judgment.
</p>
<p>
  They may blame themselves, the guilt of surviving and/or leaving their battle budd(y/ies) behind, is a crippling cycle of incrimination and damnation.
</p>
<p>
  Tell them soothing things that a mother would tell her daughter/son when he/she comes running home and crying&hellip;&nbsp; There, there&hellip;&nbsp; It's
  OK, it's OK&hellip;&nbsp; I'm here for you&hrllip;&nbsp; I love you&hellip;&nbsp; I'm glad that you made it home&hellip;&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Also, encouraging
  phrases and/or words &#8212; go on, I'm listening, OK, uh huh, ya, etc. &#8212; can help to encourage the soldier/veteran to go on.&nbsp; Silence can be an
  effective communicator of interest in listening.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, this is more about the soldier/veteran.&nbsp; Let them lead the way and don't push them into talking when they wouldn't be comfortable.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this helps.&nbsp; If you want to understand why they do the things that they do and/or what may be going on in their mind, browse <a
    href="{{ site.uri.blog }}" rel="me" title="">my blog</a>, I've put my heart into it, and think that it closely resembles what many combat veterans may feel
  and/or think themselves.
