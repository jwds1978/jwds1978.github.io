Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time; and, without stepping on each other's toes.&nbsp; It's a
distributed version control system.

If you've got around about 15 minutes or so, and want to learn about Git, I'd reccommend having a look at
<a href="https://try.github.io" target="_blank" title="Git Tutorial">Try Git</a>.

At some point, in the near future, I'll be publishing tutorials regarding various development-centric subjects.&nbsp; More than likely, they'll find
themselves embodied as blog entries, living within their own category.&nbsp; Stay tuned&hellip;
