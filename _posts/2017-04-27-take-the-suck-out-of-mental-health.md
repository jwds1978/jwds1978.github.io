  I was joking with some friends the other day, about inventing a stress vacuum, to neatly suck-up and dispose of any and all issues that interfere with our
  lives.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be nice?&nbsp; It seems that there are always times in our lives where things start going sideways and our stress feels out of
  control.&nbsp; During these times, it comforts me to know that programs are available to assist us in dealing with the stressors that life throws our
  way.&nbsp; What does still surprise me though, is how many times that I hear people are reluctant to access such services&hellip;&nbsp; Primarily, because
  they feel that they're &quot;stressed out&quot; and just need to suck it up &#8212; no vacuum pun intended.&nbsp; This disheartens me, as I'd hoped that our
  society was well past this stigma, and could understand that seeking help isn't a sign of weakness &#8212; rather, as one of strength.

  Positive mental health isn't about being problem-free and/or never having a bad day nor experiencing a life change that impacts us negatively.&nbsp; Instead,
  it's the ability to cope during such rough times.&nbsp; Stress is inevitable, and the more skills that we learn to build resiliency, the more able we are to
  battle through the tough times &#8212; coming out on top.

  Mental Health Week is May 1<sup>st</sup>&#8211;7<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; Take this, perfect, opportunity to be loud and proud &#8212; encourage everyone to break
  this stigma by learning, talking, and/or engaging with others on all sorts of issues related to mental health.&nbsp; As wellness champions, there are a lot of
  different things that we can do to make this happen:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Arrange a lunch time recharging activity, such as a dance class and/or a walk in the park.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold a fundraising event with donations going to a local mental health organization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Host a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-hats-on-for-mental-health-day-2017" rel="me" title="Hats On For Mental Health Day 2017">Hats On for
      Mental Health</a> day.&nbsp; It's a fun initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
      Host a lunch-and-learn information session.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use this time to inform people about the services that programs, of which you're familiar, can deliver.&nbsp; Not only do they provide short-term
      counselling, there are also services to help find a work-life balance by improving one's nutrition, assisting with lifestyle changes, helping with issues
      such as elder and/or child care and providing legal and/or financial advice.
    </li>
  </ul>

  When explaining the importance of taking care of yourself first, I like to use the analogy of the oxygen mask on an airplane.&nbsp; The safety speech advises
  you to put on your own mask prior to assisting others with putting on theirs.&nbsp; If you aren't strong, then you can't be a support to those who depend upon
  you.&nbsp; As much as we may wish it were true, we don't live in a vacuum and stress sucks &#8212; I promise that's the last vacuum pun!&nbsp; Essentially,
  the moral of the story, is that it's alright to ask for help &#8212; you'll be better off for it.&nbsp; Spread the mental health love and support by taking
  part in Mental Health Week.&nbsp; You and your friends will be glad that you did!
