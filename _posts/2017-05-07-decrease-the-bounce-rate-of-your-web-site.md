<p>
  Web masters tend to concentrate on increasing traffic to their Web site, but two important factors which which often fail to be considered, are user behaviour
  and user engagement.&nbsp; Factors, such as these, matter substantially.&nbsp; When a Web site gets 10,000 hits per day, but all of its visitors leave the Web
  site after visiting only a single Web page, it's not likely to be a quality Web site.
</p>
<p>
  Today, we'll be learning what the term &quot;bounce rate&quot; means.&nbsp; The bounce rate of a Web site's an analytical factor that's used to determine what
  actions people are taking after arriving at your landing page(s).&nbsp; Are they moving to other Web pages of your Web site or are they jumping away to an
  entirely different Web site.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Your Web site's bounce rate's a great measurement for the success of your Web site.&nbsp; Granted, maintaining a good bounce rate's difficult, it's not
  impossible.&nbsp; I'll share few tips which have been successful in helping me to decrease the bounce rate of my own Web sites.&nbsp; They should be helpful
  to you too.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="whats-bounce-rate">
  What's &quot;Bounce Rate&quot;?
</h3>
<p>
  The bounce rate's the best way to analyze the activity of your Web site's visitors.&nbsp; It refers to the percentage of visits, during which a visitor lands
  on your Web page, and leaves that Web page without visiting any other Web page within your Web site.&nbsp; There are visitors who bounce soon after landing
  upon your Web site.&nbsp; It's up to you how you welcome visitors to your Web site and to attract the visitor's to other Web pages of your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, let's get a few basics out of the way:
  <ul>
    <li>
      &quot;Bounce rate&quot; and &quot;exit rate&quot; refer to two, disinctly, separate things.
    </li>
    <li>
      High bounce rates are bad for your Web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lower your bounce rate, the better.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-bounce-rate" rel="me" title="Bounce rate"><img
    alt="" height="32" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/05/07/decrease-the-bounce-rate-of-your-web-site/bounce-rate_formula_53x32.png"
    style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="53" /></a>
  <ul>
    <li>
      R<sub>b</sub>&nbsp; =&nbsp; Bounce Rate
    </li>
    <li>
      T<sub>e</sub>&nbsp; =&nbsp; Total Entries to the Web Page
    </li>
    <li>
      T<sub>v</sub>&nbsp; =&nbsp; Total Number of Visitors Viewing One Web Page Only
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Now, let's try to understand how the abovementioned formula works.&nbsp; Let us suppose, that this article gets 100 visits, and 50 people leave the Web site
  after viewing this individual Web page.&nbsp; Their exit could be for any number of reasons &#8212; they closed the tab within their Web browser for whatever
  reason, they don't browse other Web pages in general, they moved to another Web site, etc.&nbsp; Given that, as an eaxample, the bounce rate would be 50%
  &#8212; R<sub>b</sub> = 50 &divide; 100.
</p>

  Strategies to Decrease &quot;Bounce Rate&quot;
</h3>
<p>
  If you're making use of Google Analytics, you can quickly log-in to your Web site's dashboard and check the bounce rate for a particular time-frame.&nbsp; If
  you've made any design changes in recently, I'd suggest that you compare bounce rates before and after the design change was implemented.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Design and Load Time
</h4>
<p>
  It's said that the first impression's the lasting impression &#8212; this holds true for Web sites too.&nbsp; When a visitor lands upon your Web page, the
  first things that they notice are your <a
    href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Template Monster">Web site's design</a> and its loading time.&nbsp;
  If you promote your articles on social media, make sure that your landing page doesn't take much time to load.&nbsp; Otherwise, you may lose your new
  visitor's interest.&nbsp; Design's another aspect of attracting visitors &#8212; it's best to go for a <a
    href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Template Monster">professional and smooth theme</a>.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Open Links to External Web Sites in New Tabs
</h4>
<p>
  Now that you understand what the term &quot;bounce rate&quot; means, you also understand how important it is for your visitors to stick to your Web
  site.&nbsp; These days, almost all of the popular Web browsers, offer a tabbed Web browsing experience.&nbsp; It's important to take advantage of this, by
  making all of the links to external Web sites, open within a new tab.&nbsp; A <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-why-external-links-should-open-in-new-tabs" rel="me" title="Why External Links Should Open in New Tabs">case-study
  by UX Movement</a>, explains the science of opening Web sites within a new tab &#8212; and, why this is important for your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  In short, when you're linking to any Web site &#8212; Wikipedia, YouTube, etc. &#8212; opt to open it within a new tab.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Easy-to-Read Content
</h4>
<p>
  There are many Web masters who don't write concise nor pointed content.&nbsp; Dividing your Web site into parts &#8212; paragraphs, that are separated by
  spaces &#8212; creates a good and intuitive user experience.&nbsp; If you don't divide your Web site into parts, visitors will have greater difficulty
  negotiating the Web page, and they can feel overwhelmed by the amount of unbroken text before them.&nbsp; Furthermore, other Web masters and/or visitors land
  on your article because they want information on that topic.&nbsp; They may not have time to spend reading line-by-line-by-line.&nbsp; So, you want to offer
  them an easily skimmed Web page.
</p>
<p>
  Make your Web page scannable and easy-to-read for your visitors.&nbsp; Try to give a style to your headings (i.e. H2, H3, H4, etc.) and use them to make your
  content scannable.&nbsp; This will also aid you in driving traffic via social media Web sites.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Related Posts
</h4>
<p>
  Showing related posts helps a lot.&nbsp; Once a visitor's finished reading the Web page, they may want to read more about that topic and/or a similar
  one.&nbsp; Think of yourself as a Web site visitor.&nbsp; What kind of action do you take after reading an article?&nbsp; There are many WordPress plug-ins,
  such as Yarpp, which recommends posts on related topics.&nbsp; This works out-of-the-box and makes it easy to add related posts.
</p>
<p>
  Preferably, placing related posts after the main article.&nbsp; Also, showing related posts with thumbnails and/or bullets has an extra advantage &#8212; it
  increases the CTR (click-through rate).
</p>
<p>
  I'd like to suggest that you start showing related posts based upon categories and/or tags.&nbsp; More closely related posts, will encourage more clicks.
</p>
<p>
  Writing posts on topics related to your most viewed Web pages can make a significant difference to the success of your Web site &#8212; helping you to
  increase a visitor's time on your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Easy Navigation
</h4>
<p>
  Your Web site should make it easy to navigate from one Web page to another.&nbsp; Visitors shouldn't get confused about the Web site's navigation.&nbsp; If
  they don't find what they're looking for, quickly enough, they'll most surely leave your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Relevant Links and Site Search
</h4>
<p>
  It's always recommended to have a search box which is clearly visible.&nbsp; Visitors almost always prefer to search for articles.&nbsp; If you want to
  decrease your bounce rate, ensure that you link only relevant articles to each other.&nbsp; Irrelevant articles may irritate your visitors &#8212; they'll
  leave your Web site, if that's the case.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Internal Links
</h4>
<p>
  This is one factor, that helps a lot, to let your visitors remain on your Web site.&nbsp; Try to inter-link your Web pages as much as possible.&nbsp; If
  you've seen Wikipedia's SEO strategies, you know that they add lots of internal links within a Web page.&nbsp; This also helps with boosting your search
  engine ranking, if you're linking using the anchor technique.
</p>
<p>
  If you're using WordPress, you can use <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-seo-smart-links" rel="me" title="SEO Smart Links">SEO Smart Links</a> to
  automagically inter-link posts with your desired keywords.&nbsp; This is one highly-recommended tip to decrease the bounce rate of any Web site.&nbsp; This
  will also help to increase a visitor's average time spent on your Web site, and will cause readers to browse more internal Web pages.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Bounce rates show how many visitors like to read your Web site content and/or find your Web site interesting.&nbsp; So, be certain that you use the strategies
  described herein in order to decrease the bounce rate of your Web site(s).
