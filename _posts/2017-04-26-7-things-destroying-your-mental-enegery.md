<p>
  I know you want to have more extended periods of focus throughout your day.&nbsp; We all do.&nbsp; Deep work's where the magic happens.
</p>
<p>
  Finding that time can be difficult.&nbsp; Light interactions bog us down.&nbsp; Answering e-mails, addressing questions from employees in the hallway, phone
  calls, etc. &#8212; it all adds up.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes we just need more energy.&nbsp; Many of us get caught in a cycle of destruction.&nbsp; I've been there before.&nbsp; When I first became an
  entrepreneur, I was miserable.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Here are 7 things that were killing my mental energy &#8212; and, some simple solutions that I've found &#8212; to help ensure that they don't slow me down:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Poor sleep.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          We all know that we need more sleep.&nbsp; The first time that I'd been able to finally get a handle on my sleep patterns happened when I installed a
          sleep-cycle app on my mobile device.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The app doesn't help me to sleep.&nbsp; But, it provides me with the base-line data that I need to track how deep my sleep is.&nbsp; I was forced to
          confront the reality that going to bed past 2300, and waking up at 0500, was killing me.&nbsp; At times, you need a slap in the face.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Install such an app, get better sleep, and start to feel better&hellip;&nbsp; You're welcome.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Anger.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Alright, this is a touchy one.&nbsp; I've thought deeply about anger before.&nbsp; Because, well, I tend to get angry at times.&nbsp; I'd imagine that
          you do as well.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          I've found that harnessing some anger, and channeling it in a productive manner, helps to propel me to new heights.&nbsp; But, if anger's an issue for
          you, meditation may help.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <a

            title="New Study Shows Brief Meditation Can Reduce Anger">A study</a> shows that brief meditation &#8212; just 20 minutes &#8212; can reduce your
          anger.&nbsp; I've been meditating for goin on 10 years now.&nbsp; You don't need apps and/or books to help you focus on your breath.&nbsp; But, if you
          find it difficult though, you may want to consider installing an app such as Headspace.&nbsp; The meditations are simple and effective.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Perfectionism.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Another tough one.&nbsp; I've been a perfectionist for the better part of my life.&nbsp; I'd imagine, that if you're reading this, you may be one
          yourself.&nbsp; We're self-improvement beasts.&nbsp; Always seeking to become bigger, faster, and/or stronger.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Here's a fast hack to break-free from your perfectionism&hellip;&nbsp; Become a parent and/or start a company.&nbsp; I'm, absolutely, serious.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you're a parent, you more than likely chuckled a bit here, but it's true though.&nbsp; You can't be an effective and high-functioning parent if
          you're a perfectionist.&nbsp; At some point, you have to throw your hands in the air, and let go.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So, let it go &#8212; allow yourself some room to break some eggs.&nbsp; The psychic energy that you'll free-up will make up for any anxiety that you
          have around your perfectionism.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Taking a perfectionist attitude will only lead to depression and anxiety.&nbsp; Plus, here's the reality &#8212; you can, never, have perfection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The wrong crowd.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Your mom was right &#8212; you shouldn't get involved with the wrong crowd.&nbsp; High-energy overachievers surround themselves with the same
          energy &#8212; so do negative people.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Be careful who you spend your time with, and harness the positive energy, from the good people around you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Negative stacking.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          We all have to &quot;<a

            title="Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time">eat the frog</a>&quot; and get things accomplished that
          we hate doing.&nbsp; I've found a powerful technique that helps me plow through my negative duties.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Some will tell you to tackle your hardest projects first-thing in the morning when you're fresh.&nbsp; I agree with this, given one minor
          caveat&hellip;&nbsp; After you do that one hard thing, do something that you enjoy.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Alternating, these minor tasks, will keep you from stringing negative experiences together.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Too much alcohol.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          We all know that a glass a wine now-and-then can be good for your heart.&nbsp; I'm not going to encourage you stop drinking.&nbsp; We all want to grab
          a beer with our former college roommates.&nbsp; That's healthy.&nbsp; Consistent, week-day drinking though, just doesn't work.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Excessive alcohol consumption negatively effects your sleep.&nbsp; A bad night's sleep will decrease your performance the next day.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Allow yourself to have a glass of wine and/or a beer now-and-then.&nbsp; Work out, mediate, and eat-well to alleviate the need to binge-drink and
          release stress and tension.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Foods high in sugar.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          We know that foods high in sugar are bad for us &#8212; and, our mental acuity.&nbsp; So, why do we still put them into our bodies?&nbsp; Sugar's
          addictive &#8212; could be one answer.&nbsp; But, another answer, seems to be the reason &#8212; sugar work!<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          When we put sugar into our bodies, we get a shot in the arm.&nbsp; For about 20 minutes, we feel fantastic and on top of the world.&nbsp; We don't
          think about the long-term effects.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          You could eat sugary foods all day, but you'd end up packing on fat &#8212; pushing your body into a depression.

  I'm a bit obsessed with creating the optimal biologically successful day.&nbsp; I hope that gaining some form of control over these 7 mental pitfalls will
  help to bring optimal performance into your life.
