<p>
  There are myriad psychology models and theories on what motivates us to do the things we do:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Achievement theories.
    </li>
    <li>
      How we respond to incentives.
    </li>
    <li>
      &hellip;
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  I view motivation as excitement.&nbsp; So, how can you remain motivated in a simple way that works every single day?
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Here are 10 ways:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Take a break &#8212; you deserve it.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          The only way that we can perform at an optimal level is to create time for rest.&nbsp; The moment that you know you can't take any time off is,
          usually, when you need it the most.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So take that long delayed vacation and return to your business with a renewed enthusiasm.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep your cards close to your chest.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Finally running that marathon?&nbsp; Excited about your new diet?&nbsp; Bursting at the seams over your new project?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Keep it to
          yourself.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Announcing your intent to do these feats will backfire.&nbsp; Resist the urge to reap the barrage of Facebook likes and gushing comments.&nbsp; The
          positive feedback that you receive from your network will trick your brain into thinking that you've already accomplished your goal &#8212; sabotaging
          your once-motivated brain to do said feat.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So, keep it to yourself and share the good news once you've already done it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Confront death &#8212; define your legacy.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Death's a powerful motivator.&nbsp; We get bogged-down in mindless activities.&nbsp; They make us feel like we're accomplishing things, when in
          reality, we're just spinning in circles.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Knowing that you have finite time on this planet, helps to sharpen your focus.&nbsp; Everything that we do's another step in defining our
          legacy.&nbsp; This may seem like heady posturing, but both can be powerful motivators.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Celebrate the wins &#8212; no matter how small.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Little wins may seem like just that &#8212; little.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          However, celebrating these wins, can help to create positive habits.&nbsp; You break the inertia of mediocrity by teaching everyone around you how to
          win.&nbsp; They get the chance to bask in that emotion.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Vishen Lakhiani, CEO of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-mindvalley" rel="me" title="Mindvalley">Mindvalley</a>, has gone so far as
          implementing what he calls the &quot;awesome bell&quot;.&nbsp; He rings &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; anytime that something awesome happens.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Slash your to-do list in half.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Slashing your aggressive to-do list in half, will allow room for success.&nbsp; Knowing that it's realistic for you to complete the list's empowering.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Be gentle with yourself.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Stop comparing the accomplishments in your life with those of your neighbour.&nbsp; The story that you create in your head will never be as good and
          the reality will never be as bad.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          There are many people who are smarter than you.&nbsp; The moment that you can embrace this notion, you're free.&nbsp; Free to explore&hellip;&nbsp;
          Free to follow what excites you&hellip;&nbsp; Free to ignore what they do, or how they do it, and focus on you.

      Hack the way in which your brain perceives new habits.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Recently, I began waking up two hours earlier than usual during the week.&nbsp; Instead of viewing it as two hours less that I get to sleep, I view it
          as

            two extra hours to my day
          </a>
          &#8212; allowing me to add a full workday each week.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Embrace vulnerability.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          We live in a culture where we horde Instagram followers and Facebook likes.&nbsp; The perception of our lives being anything less than perfect is a
          daunting notion.&nbsp; The glossy Facebookification of our lives can create a dangerous facade of success.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />

            Sharing defeats and admitting failure
          </a>'s
          a powerful cultivator of motivation, allowing you to move past the failure.&nbsp; Work through the emotion instead of taking it out on someone
          else.&nbsp; Then, move on to something more constructive.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Sharing these vulnerable moments also cultivates a deeper connection with peers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Do what you love &#8212; sort of.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Find what it is that you love to do and get proficient at it.&nbsp; Success dwells at the fulcrum of passion and excellence.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          But, be careful.&nbsp; Make sure that you can make a living from your passion.&nbsp; I'm passionate about a lot of things, that I know I'm not so
          amazing at, and that I definitely can't make a living at.&nbsp; I love playing guitar.&nbsp; My daughter loves when I play songs from the movie
          Frozen.&nbsp; It's fun.&nbsp; I'm never going to be a rock star though.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Focus.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          There's a an anecdote that I've heard about Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Gates' father at a dinner party.&nbsp; A guest asked them what the most
          important quality for success was today, and all three responded with &quot;focus&quot;, at the same exact time.&nbsp; They all smiled and laughed to
          each other because they hadn't really prepared the answer.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We're all inundated with e-mails and texts.&nbsp; These are no longer just work interruptions.&nbsp; Because of the mini-computers that we carry
          around in our pockets, the flood of information distracts us wherever we happen to be &#8212; 24/7.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So, turn off your iPhone&hellip;&nbsp; Stop trolling your ex-lover's Facebook page&hellip;&nbsp; And, get to work!
