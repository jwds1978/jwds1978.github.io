<h3>
  What's affiliate marketing?
</h3>
<p>
  Affiliate marketing consists in the system of rewards that a company's affiliate may get as a result of bringing new customers to the company.&nbsp; Hence, a
  win-win situation&hellip;&nbsp; A business attracts new clients without spending a fortune on traditional advertising campaigns, whereas a committed
  affiliate, enjoys a promotion fee each time that they're successful in making the prospect click &quot;buy&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Such systems are comprised of four main players:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The affiliate.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The one that assumes the role of an advertising channel for a company.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The customer.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The core element of any business, at which all marketing activities are targeted.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The retailer.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A company that decides to promote its goods and/or services with the help of affiliates.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The network.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Both the available choice of offers for the affiliate and the payment and tracking system.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Thus, if you're willing to launch a Web site with relevant and up-to-date quality content, an affiliate program will serve you just fine.
</p>

  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h4>
  How, Exactly
</h4>
<p>
  Your task could not be simpler.&nbsp; All that you need to do, is to choose the most suitable affiliate program with the most beneficial terms of use, and
  continue delivering a sort of content that will make your page stand out from the range of similar ones.&nbsp; This will help you to attract more visitors to
  your Web site&hellip;&nbsp; And, consequently, increase your earnings.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, there's no need to transform your Web site into a wall of ads if this is what scares you off.&nbsp; A couple of affiliate adverts on a Web page will
  suffice.&nbsp; Especially, if you've already gathered a big group of loyal subscribers.
</p>
<p>
  However, the problem with affiliate programs is that they directly reflect your organic ranking.&nbsp; Thus, if your Web site loses its position in Google,
  your earnings may also drop.&nbsp; Thus, it's quite risky to count on affiliate programs alone.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
  What to Consider when Selecting an Affiliate Program
</h3>
<p>
  Deceptively similar, they are.&nbsp; Although many affiliate programs are often considered totally interchangeable, they may in-fact be completely different
  regarding prospective revenues as well as ease-of-use.&nbsp; The following are just a few aspects that should be taken into account.
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="235" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/13/how-to-get-the-most-of-affiliate-programs/innominate_02_482x235.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h4>
  Method of Payment
</h4>
<p>
  One of the most striking differences between various affiliate programs consists in the model by which affiliates receive their advertising fees.&nbsp; While
  choosing a program for your Web site, this aspect should be paid the most attention.&nbsp; Below, are the most frequently used models, for your consideration:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pay per Click (PPC)
      <ul>
        <li>
          As may be inferred from its name, PPC is all about paying a commission according to the number of times that your site visitors follow the advertised
          link; irrespective of actions they take after that.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Pay per Lead (PPL)
      <ul>
        <li>
          The retailer pays you a fixed commission, each time a lead from your Web site makes a certain action (i.e. fills out a form, registers, requests a
          trial, subscribes to a newsletter, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Pay per Sale (PPS)
      <ul>
        <li>
          This time, you receive a percentage of all sales generated through your Web site.&nbsp; A model pretty similar to how sales managers get a substantial
          part of their incomes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="271" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/13/how-to-get-the-most-of-affiliate-programs/innominate_03_482x271.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h4>
  Commission
</h4>
<p>
  Commission is the actual amount of money that you're to get from a successful usage of affiliate advertising.&nbsp; So it's vital that you compare the
  available options before going for a particular program.&nbsp; Well, the significance of this aspect can't be over-estimated.&nbsp; It's the commission that
  tells you whether the whole idea of affiliate marketing is worth the candle.
</p>
<p>
  Commission may differ according to the payment method in-force since it's obvious that a simple click on the affiliate link is less effective than closing a
  deal with a customer.
</p>
<h4>
  Relevance
</h4>
<p>
  More subjective than the aspects above, relevance still plays a crucial role in affiliate programs.&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; Well, to achieve the
  desired effect and generate more &quot;clicks&quot;, you have to make sure that things you're advertising is in-line with the content on your Web page.&nbsp;
  Otherwise, it would be really difficult to find your target audience.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, it's crucial that you watch the competition thoroughly.&nbsp; You'll notice that products that are promoted the most are the most popular among the
  public.&nbsp; So, it's really in your best interest to advertise them as well.&nbsp; Especially, at the beginning of your business, when you don't have your
  loyal subscribers yet.
</p>
<p>

<h3>
  Top 3 Affiliate Programs
</h3>
<p>
  We both know how time-consuming it is to look through the whole plethora of options when trying to opt for the most suitable one.&nbsp; The motive is
  clear&hellip;&nbsp; Everyone is eager to get the most out of the available.&nbsp; I've made a choice easier for you, by selecting the top three affiliate
  programs; one of which, will meet your needs.&nbsp; So, here's the shortlist.
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="158" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/13/how-to-get-the-most-of-affiliate-programs/Google_AdSense_482x158.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h4>
  Google AdSense
</h4>
<p>
  One of the greatest advantages of Google AdSense, is that it holds the largest base of online ads.&nbsp; Which, makes it so attractive to Web site
  owners.&nbsp; Indeed, there's a plethora of options to choose from, which enables you to.&nbsp; However, this naturally results in the highest competition for
  an ad position among advertisers.&nbsp; On the one hand, the cost-per-click increases with the growing competition, and if you manage to get the much-desired
  ad, you'll probably enjoy pretty high rates.&nbsp; On the other hand, your Web site must stand out from the range of similar ones if you want to advertise
  through AdSense.
</p>
<p>
  The problem with Google AdSense is that its commission is paid solely for the clicks.&nbsp; Which may sometimes be quite disappointing, for example, if
  your Web site brings them a $500 sale.&nbsp; So, in essence, it cannot be called an affiliate network&hellip;&nbsp; One of the defining characteristics of
  which is a percentage of sales paid to the affiliate.
</p>
<p>
  On the contrary, AdSense works similarly to ad network where your site plays a role of a cheap advertising channel.&nbsp; Not that interesting, right?
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps, the biggest issue with Google AdSense, is the nine circles of Hell that you have to go through in order to sign-up.
</p>
<p>
  Your Web site has to be in-line with
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-adsense-program-policies" rel="me" title="AdSense program policies">its policies</a>, which can be changed at any
  time, making the whole platform unpredictable and unstable.&nbsp; Even the application has to be submitted in a strictly prescribed form.
</p>
<p>
  To be considered eligible for participation in Google AdSense, you have to follow a great number of rules.&nbsp; Including, but not limited to, the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Clicking on your links or asking others to do so is prohibited.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor your organic traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      No modification of the Code of Implementation Guide is permitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      You must provide interesting and relevant content for your visitors.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should maintain a good balance between original content and ads.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your content must be original.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your content should be family-friendly.&nbsp; Thus, no explicit materials can be shown.&nbsp;
      <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-adult-content-content-policies-adsense" rel="me" title="Adult Content :: Content Policies :: AdSense">
        Read more
      </a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your Web page layout must be understandable.&nbsp; Hence, no deceptive ways to obtain extra clicks.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Many of AdSense rules seem pretty ambiguous as there's no clear line as to what is OK and what isn't.&nbsp; This may lead to policy violation warnings and a
  great deal of other problems.
</p>
<p>
  Frankly speaking, the positives of Google AdSense don't seem to come even close to outweighing its negatives.&nbsp; Which, makes the program unreasonably
  complicated and inconvenient.&nbsp; If that doesn't scare you off, let me give you a heads-up on how to work with it.
</p>
<p>
  If you think that you can sign-up to AdSense and start making money out of their ads right away, don't count your chicken before they're hatched.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.&nbsp; But, I've got you covered and am more than happy to describe the main requirements that you need to comply
  with.
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="174" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/13/how-to-get-the-most-of-affiliate-programs/policies_482x174.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h5>
  Follow the Policies
</h5>
<p>
  That's the most basic requirement.&nbsp; I don't think someone would be surprised, that in order to sign-up for some program, they need to follow a bunch of
  rules.
</p>
<p>
  Check the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-terms-and-conditions-adsense" rel="me" title="Terms and Conditions :: AdSense">terms and conditions</a>
  page to see if your project is abiding of their policies.&nbsp; Google allows you to select your country-of-origin to be sure that you're familiar with all of
  the up-to-date terms based upon your geographic location.
</p>
<p>
  It's also important to understand that, once you're approved, you need to continue to follow these policies.&nbsp; Otherwise, your account will be disabled
  and as the AdSense Beginner's Guide states, your payments may be refused.
</p>
<img
  alt="" height="267" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/04/13/how-to-get-the-most-of-affiliate-programs/innominate_04_482x267.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<h5>
  Good Content
</h5>
<p>
  You should always keep the idea of the original content in your mind and follow it as your own White Whale.
</p>
<p>
  This is an essential rule.&nbsp; Web sites without original content will not be approved.&nbsp; If you just simply copy-and-paste some other stories from the
  Internet, AdSense will not want to work with you, since you don't generate productive and useful content.
</p>
<p>
  At this point you should understand the main point.&nbsp; If you have content with 0% of originality, you have zero-chance of getting approved.
</p>
<h5>
  Required Pages
</h5>
<p>
  Google Adsense wants for every Web site to have the following pages:
  <ul>
    <li>
      About
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact
    </li>
    <li>
      Privacy Policy
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Basically, all three pages will help AdSense to understand that your Web site isn't a fraudulent project.&nbsp; Let me walk you through each page, so that you
  have a basic understanding of what you need to put out there.
</p>
<h6>
  Privacy Policy
</h6>
<p>
  I'm sure that you all have seen the privacy policies on big Web blogs, sites, and stores.&nbsp; This is one of those things that you won't get approval
  without.&nbsp; If you don't have a privacy policy page, you shouldn't even bother hoping that AdSense will check the rest of the requirements.&nbsp; They
  check the policy first and go from there.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays it's rather easy to generate a privacy policy for your blog or store.&nbsp; There are plenty of online resources to do that.&nbsp; I'll give you a
  few of them:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.iubenda.com" target="_blank" title="Generate a privacy policy in seconds. Easy. Fast. Beautiful.">
        Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy Generator

    </li>

        href="https://termsfeed.com/privacy-policy/generator" target="_blank"
        title="Generate a Privacy Policy, 2017 up-to-date, for your business with the Privacy Policy Generator from TermsFeed.">
        Privacy Policy Generator
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h6>
  About Page
</h6>
<p>
  This is the page where you can describe your project and about yourself a little bit.&nbsp; This helps Google to see that you're not a fraud and that you're
  not holding anything back.
</p>
<p>
  Actually, this is the easiest one; and, there are no required guidelines to follow.&nbsp; Just be sincere and tell your audience about the Web site which you
  run.
</p>
<h6>
  Contact Page
</h6>
<p>
  A page with your contact information will show Google that you care about your clients/readers and that you're always ready to help them.&nbsp; No matter what
  issue and/or question that they have, they'll be able to get in touch with you.
</p>
<p>
  While writing this paragraph, I had an epiphany&hellip;&nbsp; If you don't have a contact page, you not only lose out on the Adsense approval, but you also
  lose a lot of potential partners who want to get in touch with you.&nbsp; So this page isn't only essential for Adsense compliance, but it's a must for any
  self-respecting blogger and/or entrepreneur.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t forget to make use of a serious e-mail, such as john.doe@your-web-site-domain.net instead of a free e-mail account (i.e. Gmail, Yahoo, etc.).&nbsp; It
  shows how serious you are about what you do.&nbsp; It's not a playground, it's business.
</p>
<h5>
  Beautiful Design
</h5>
<p>
  Appearance matters, no matter what you've been advised by a hippie whose only business is selling drugs on the street and sleeping in his van.&nbsp; That's
  why I strongly advise getting yourself a premium theme and/or design your Web site yourself, if you have all the necessary skills.
</p>
<p>
  The clean and good-looking template will be always appreciated by Google.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the
  <a href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_WordPress" target="_blank">amazing WordPress themes</a> and
  <a href="{{ site.uri.shortURL }}/Template-Monster_Templates" target="_blank">Web site templates</a>.&nbsp; Pick yourself something to represent your
  appearance on the Internet.
</p>
<h5>
  Visitors and Web Site Age
</h5>
<p>
  At first, you may think that these requirements are too harsh.&nbsp; That may be true, but you more than likely won't be approved if you don't have a minimum
  of 50+ visitors per day.&nbsp; And, there's even more&hellip;&nbsp; You shouldn't apply for the Google AdSense if your Web site is less than 6 months old.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, it sounds as though AdSense is picky.&nbsp; However, let's be honest&hellip;&nbsp; How are you planning on getting money without traffic and/or
  clients?&nbsp; Who's going to click on the ads, your grandma?
</p>
<h5>
  Sitemap Matters
</h5>
<p>
  Google is a big fan of these, so you've got to prepare them and make sure that you actually have them.&nbsp; Setting it up is quite easy.&nbsp; Especially,
  with the help of lots of good plug-ins out there.
</p>
<p>
  Once everything's ready on your end, and you're sure that you comply with all of the requirements,
  <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/g-app-single-1?hl=en&signup=rs&subid=ww-ww-org-signup" target="_blank" title="">feel free to apply</a>.&nbsp; The
  process is relatively easy and user-friendly, as with all of the Google services.&nbsp; The most commonly requested information regarding AdSense can be found
  on <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/#topic=3373519" target="_blank" title="">their support page</a> and/or discussed in
  <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/adsense" target="_blank" title="">their community</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you follow all of the guidelines from this article, you should be approved without any problems.&nbsp; So, just apply and go get yourself a cup of coffee.

<h4>
  Amazon Associates Affiliate Program
</h4>
<p>
  Being the biggest online retailer in the world, Amazon provides an affiliate program that has expectedly become one of the most popular of its kind.
</p>
<p>
  With &gt; 1 million products available in the shop, you may be sure that you'll find something that fits your Web site subject and style.&nbsp; Moreover,
  thanks to customizable product preview, you can yourself decide how the ad will look like in practice.
</p>
<p>
  Similar to
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-affiliate-program-template-monster" rel="me" title="Affiliate Program :: Template Monster">Template Monster</a>,
  Amazon has a range of responsive online tools aimed at facilitating the use of the program.&nbsp; By the way, another common feature between the two programs
  is that they both provide a possibility to open a fully-fledged online shop.&nbsp; So, if you ever feel tired of your constant content creation, there will
  always be an option to shift to eCommerce completely.
</p>
<p>
  However, despite all of the benefits, Amazon Associates isn't perfect&hellip;&nbsp; Its commission is quite poor in comparison to many other programs using
  the same PPS model.&nbsp; Moreover, commission fees differ a lot according to the category of goods.&nbsp; The rate begins with 1% for video game console
  products to the maximum of 10% for game downloads and Amazon Coins.&nbsp; Apart from that, there are also special bounty fees that you may receive if an
  eligible customer performs a specific action considered a &quot;Bounty Event&quot; (i.e. registration for Amazon Prime Free Trial, registration for Amazon
  Student, etc.).&nbsp; The bounty rate may vary from $0.50 to $25.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to bear in mind that there are additional restrictions on the maximum commission rate for certain products.&nbsp; All personal computers and
  similar items, for example, may bring you no more than $25 per sale.&nbsp; Whereas, regarding fine art, this amount is limited to $200.&nbsp; So, if you were
  considering the promotion of fancy goods on your Web site, mind that your earnings will fall far behind.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Amazon Associates seems to be a good option on paper.&nbsp; Yet, in practice, it turns out to be a stingy billion-worth store, unwilling to share its
  revenues.&nbsp; So, even if you're attracted by the range of goods available for advertising, consider your prospective incomes before jumping into the
  program.
</p>
<p>
  Amazon is one of the biggest eCommerce players out there and we all know that millions of customers all over the world give this store a one hundred percent
  trust.&nbsp; I've bought around 5 items over the past 3 months myself.&nbsp; So, you see what I'm saying.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not telling you this for no reason.&nbsp; Since Amazon is a trustworthy store, your Web site visitors will not have any trust issues with the referral
  links that you put in your blog.&nbsp; Amazon Associates has its benefits and they make this program worth, at least, trying out.
</p>
<h5>
  Easy to Join
</h5>
<p>
  The process is much easier than with AdSense.&nbsp; You'll be able to complete your registration process within a few minutes.
</p>
<h5>
  A Lot of Products to Choose From
</h5>
<p>
  It doesn't matter what kind of niche Web site that you own, you'll definitely find a product to advertise and sell.
</p>
<h5>
  Payments for Completed Orders
</h5>
<p>
  Once your Web site visitor follows your referral link, there is a 24-hour window in which to close the sale.&nbsp; The best part is that you'll get
  commissions for the full order, not only for the product that your customer clicked on.&nbsp; So, sometimes a customer follows your link, then they decide to
  click on a more expensive product, adds it to their cart, adds more products, and completes the order.&nbsp; In this case, you'll receive commissions for all
  of the products in their cart.
</p>
<p>
  If this one sounds interesting to you, make sure that you try it out by signing up here.&nbsp; Pay attention to the fact that Amazon offers you to select the
  marketplace that you want to join.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, if you don't live in any of the listed countries, you should select &quot;United States&quot;.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It's quite simple&hellip;&nbsp;
  Many of the other marketplaces simply don't offer international shipping.&nbsp; So, if you're not from one of those, there's no sense in joining them.
</p>
<p>
  In order to start an account with Amazon Associates, you'll have to answer a lot of questions.&nbsp; Let me show you step-by-step, how to sign-up for this
  affiliate program, and give you some hints on how to start earning money with it properly.
</p>
<p>
  On the main page of Amazon Associates, click on &quot;Join Now for Free&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Create a new account by entering your e-mail address, name, and password.&nbsp; Enter the name of the person Amazon should issue the check to.&nbsp; Address,
  city, province/state, postal/zip code, country, and phone number.&nbsp; Enter the address of your Web site and/or a link to the mobile app you want to
  advertise Amazon products in.&nbsp; You'll also have to let Amazon know if your Web site or mobile app is directed, primarily, at children under 13 years old.
</p>
<p>
  At this point you have to select your preferred Associates store ID and fill-in the general information about your Web site and/or mobile app.&nbsp; Amazon
  also wants to know how you advertise your Web site, how many visitors you usually have on a monthly basis, and what's the reason that you decided to join the
  Amazon Affiliate program for.&nbsp; The final step, is the 'identity verification'.&nbsp; This is a very simple process that involves you, your phone, and the
  PIN code provided by Amazon.

<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  Despite all the drawbacks of affiliate marketing, it remains part-and-parcel of any blogging career.&nbsp; No matter what content you focus on, affiliate
  programs provide a wide array of ads applicable in any context.
</p>
<p>
  Anyhow, the biggest problem with them lies in this diversity; given the fact that your primary task as an affiliate consists in selecting the goods which will
  complement your overall content strategy.&nbsp; Although the chosen three programs cannot represent the entire competition in the market, I listed them
  according to the principle of &quot;two popular ones &amp; one dark horse&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  The analysis of their competitive advantages speaks for itself.&nbsp; The lesser known
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-affiliate-program-template-monster" rel="me" title="Affiliate Program :: Template Monster">
    Template Monster affiliate program
  </a>
  turns out to be far more attractive.&nbsp; Especially, given its sound payment model.&nbsp; However, the other two cannot be completely neglected, since they
  have a greater diversification of products available for promotion.
</p>
<p>
  Well, I know that I've given you some good food for thought.&nbsp; But, I hope that it will help you to make the right choice.
