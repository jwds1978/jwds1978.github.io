Fuck&hellip; my&hellip; life&hellip; Having a look at the image below, what doesn't belong?<br />

Lately, I've been noticing that my car is burning through upward of &frac14; tank per day.&nbsp; Significantly, more than usual.&nbsp; Somebody who was
driving behind me the other day told me that they saw something dragging under my vehicle.

Upon inspection, I come to realize that one of the oxygen sensors was dragging the ground.&nbsp; FFS!&nbsp; Given that, it's now damaged beyond simply
returning it to where it lives.&nbsp; I will now need to buy a new damn unit.

While I can more than likely get one from the scrap yard, I'll have to replace it now regardless.&nbsp; For the time being, I've simply zip-tied the damn
thing up inside of the engine compartment.
