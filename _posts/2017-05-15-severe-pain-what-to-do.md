<p>
  People in chronic pain, such as myself, are feeling the impact of the legal changes regarding the use of opioid analgesics for severe pain.&nbsp; I used to
  detest pain medications.&nbsp; I did all that I could to avoid making use of opioids &#8212; relying upon 8&#8211;10+G of Ibuprofen each day instead.&nbsp; As
  I age though, I'm finding that the effects of the extreme abuse which I'd put my body through is fast catching up with my gimp-ass.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  I hurt every-fucking-where and it's become quite miserable when I'm off of my pain management medications.&nbsp; Trust me &#8212; I don't wish to be on them
  &#8212; but, I need them all the same.&nbsp; While I do somewhat understand the changes in law, all that the lawmakers are accomplishing is to make people
  like me live in absolute fucking Hell &#8212; the addicts and/or abusers, they simply turn to more heroin.&nbsp; You'll never be able to control the
  addicts.&nbsp; To punish those whom don't abuse it, and require them to live a relatively normal life, is abso-fucking-lutely unjust.
</p>
<p>
  I'm living in a constant pain that I'd not wish upon my worst enemy.&nbsp; The pain is excrutiating most times and my mobility is drastically decreasing with
  each passing month.&nbsp; The new laws, in combination with the severe lack of family doctors, has caused significant damage to countless lives across the
  nation &#8212; more damage than one could, possibly, fatham.
</p>
<p>
  I can't remember the last time that I actually had a regular family doctor &#8212; it's been quite a long time anyhow.&nbsp; The closest that I can get is to
  visit the same clinic and utilize the same pharmacy.&nbsp; I've been going to
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-northwood-medical-clinics" rel="me" title="Northwood Medical Clinics">Northwood Medical Clinics</a>, on a fairly
  regular basis, for several years now.&nbsp; WTF is one to do, when they have no family doctor nor can they readily obtain one, and clinics refuse to refill
  their prescrition(s)?
</p>
<p>
  I try to go to the same clinic, so that they have a medical history/record for me, and I need not have to re-explain my entire fucking life's story to each
  new doctor with each visit each month.&nbsp; With that said, there's a single doctor at this clinic &#8212; whom we'll call Dr. Armani Sarabia &#8212; that's
  ignorant, degrades his patients, disrespects his patients, and makes you feel as though you're a drug addict for simply wanting a refill on your already
  existing/prescribed long-term medication(s) for clear and visible injuries&hellip;&nbsp; Fuck, I had to fight with him last year, after stripping down in the
  office for him see my legs along with their visible wounds and my custom designed/manufactured orthosis &#8212; for a simple refill of my Arthrotec, FFS!
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The government had issued new guidelines which strongly urge doctors to stop prescribing narcotics to patients with chronic pain.&nbsp; While I believe its
  mandate may reduce deaths from opioid overdose, what the feds haven't considered is the impact on people with long-standing severe pain, especially if they're
  disabled.

  Changing the Rules
</h3>
<p>
  In the last couple of years, there's been a huge effort to make it harder for doctors to prescribe opioid pain relievers.&nbsp; The government's made it much
  harder for patients to obtain hydrocodone combination (i.e. Lortab, Norco, Vicodin, etc.) pain relievers.&nbsp; Previously, prescribers could call-in and/or
  send-in an electronic prescription to a pharmacy and could give a pain patient several refills.&nbsp; Now, patients typically only get a 30-day supply and
  must visit the doctor's office each time that they're in need of a refill prescription.
</p>
<p>
  The new laws have made it much more challenging for a patient who's disabled and/or in severe pain to access an opioid medication.
</p>

<h3 id="new-guidelines">
  New Guidelines
</h3>
<p>
  In essence, the new opioid guidelines state that narcotics shouldn't be prescribed for chronic pain patients.&nbsp; Rather, doctors should recommend
  acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol) or NSAIDs (i.e. aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.).&nbsp; Other suggestions include antidepressants, cognitive behavioral therapy, and/or
  exercise therapy.&nbsp; I'd suspect that there are many patients, like myself, for whom such suggestions won't be met with much enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
  For acute pain, such as after surgery or an accident, it's recommended that doctors prescribe opioids for no more than three days.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Some
  &quot;acute&quot; pain lasts substantially longer than three damn days!
</p>
<p>
  The government acknowledges that cancer treatment may require opioid medication during the active phase of therapy.&nbsp; However, what they've not taken into
  account, is that cancer survivors may have to deal with chronic pain.&nbsp; The president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said:
  <blockquote
    cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-final-cdc-opioid-prescribing-guideline-could-have-unintended-consequences-for-cancer-survivors-living-with-chronic-pain">
    Pain does not end when an individual completes treatment.&nbsp; Most often, cancer patients deal with lasting effects from their disease or treatment
    including pain for a significant period of time or indefinitely.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The guidelines fail to take that into account.
</p>

  Walking the Tightrope
</h3>
<p>
  I recognize that there's tremendous abuse of narcotics within this country, but I'm uncertain that the new guidelines will help to reduce the problem
  though.&nbsp; I've not seen convincing evidence, that making it harder for chronic pain patients to access drugs like hydrocodone, will make a huge difference
  in abuse and/or overdose deaths.
</p>
<p>
  I also believe that it's, virtually impossible, to generalize about the most appropriate treatment for people with severe chronic pain.&nbsp; Some people will
  do well with cognitive behavioral therapy, while others, can only function on opioid medications.&nbsp; These drugs allow them to work and/or function with
  some dignity.&nbsp; They don't abuse the pain medicine, don't increase the dose, and don't sell their medicine to drug abusers.&nbsp; They've now become
  vulnerable to a huge federal mandate that impacts how physicians practice medicine.
</p>
<p>
  It's my belief that the government shouldn't tell physicians how to practice medicine.&nbsp; Especially, when it comes to something as complex as chronic
  pain.&nbsp; Each patient needs to be evaluated individually and treated with respect.&nbsp; The new guidelines scare many doctors away from prescribing potent
  pain killers for longer than a few days or weeks.&nbsp; That means that some patients will live in agony, with no acceptable treatment, through no fault of
  their own.
