<p>
  B2B marketers often omit story-telling.&nbsp; Stories are considered to have a stronger impact on the end-users, rather than companies.
</p>
<p>
  However, aren't those also people representing different brands that you target?&nbsp; At the end of the day, whether you run a B2B and/or B2C campaign,
  you're selling to people &#8212; and, people like stories.
</p>
<p>
  Business owners want to see data that provides them with a clear statement, of the reasons of why, they should deal with a particular company.&nbsp; They want
  to see posts with useful information.&nbsp; However, they're also people who don't always need a narrative to understand that a specific piece of content's
  valuable.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  This, is where stories come into play.&nbsp; A good story can capture a user's attention, hold them on the page, and evoke a desire to learn where the story
  goes.&nbsp; That's why, different brands from all over the world, have started using video content and story-telling in both their B2B and B2C marketing
  campaigns &#8212; humanizing their projects, making their data relate to the readers, and revealing in what ways their offerings can transform other
  businesses.
</p>
<p>
  So, is video content or story-telling that useful for your
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-themes-for-business-and-corporate-websites" rel="me" title="Themes for Business and Corporate Websites">
    business
  </a>?&nbsp;
  Let's try to find an answer to this question while considering several cases for using story-telling within B2B marketing.

    case study
  </a>
  on how the same text delivered to their clients, through a narrative and a story, influenced the way that people reacted to it.&nbsp; What they did first, was
  a publication of an article
  &quot;<a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-how-we-got-1000-subscribers-from-a-single-blog-post-in-24-hours" rel="me"

  </a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Next, they e-mailed two versions of this text to their subscribers.&nbsp; In the first version, the text was wrapped-up into a story, where users were taken
  to the primary objective.&nbsp; As per the second version, the text was written straight to the point.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the first version showed a greater public engagement into the post.&nbsp; 300% more readers moved from the beginning, right through, to the end
  of the text &#8212; spending, an average of 5 minutes, longer to read the copy as compared to the straight-forward version.

<p>
   The Web saw many companies communicating their services to their audience(s) through stories.&nbsp; Here, are a few of the most remarkable ones&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Norton
</h4>
<p>
  The world leader in digital security, released a 20-minute documentary video, about a small and picturesque Romanian town Râmnicu Vâlcea &#8212; better known,
  as the hacker capital of the world.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <iframe

    style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  The video features stories of scammers who'd hacked accounts of the members of the presidential family, Facebook, Google, NASA, the US Army, etc.&nbsp; While
  telling stories of real people, who were imprisoned for hacking companies and organizations of all sizes, Norton transports the audience into the world of
  cyber crimes &#8212; communicating how fragile the Web space is and how important it is to take care of your virtual security.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Salesforce
</h4>
<p>
  Another world-known company, making use of videos, to deliver stories to their consumers.&nbsp; Instead of adding a regular section with user testimonials to
  the homepage of their Web site, they devote a separate page for every client who shares feedback about their services.&nbsp; Most importantly, people tell
  their success stories via videos, which are known as better attention-grabbers and stronger influencers.
</p>
<p>
  Just have a look at the Aston Martin story of using Salesforce to add a personal touch to their business.<br />

    style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Boeing
</h4>
<p>
  Replaced press releases with news stories on their Features pages.&nbsp; With the help of stories, the company tells the history of their establishment, the
  way they operate right now, as well as their plans for future.&nbsp; For example, within the Space Features block, there's a story under the title of
  &quot;<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-flight-before-the-launch" rel="me" title="The Flight Before the Launch">
    The Flight Before the Launch
  </a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  The written story, about the preparation before the launch of WGS-9 and its shipment from the Los Angeles to Florida, is accompanied by a brief explanatory
  video &#8212; making it easier for non-tech-savvy users to understand what the whole story's about, and, where it goes.<br />

  Why Video Content and Story-Telling is So Effective
</h3>
<p>
  As noted earlier, people love being entertained by visual content.&nbsp; That's why, more and more often, marketers use video ads to promote their offerings
  and to get the audience more engaged.&nbsp; In their <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-statistics" rel="me" title="Statistics">press kit</a>, the
  giant video streaming platform &#8212; YouTube &#8212; states that they receive over 1,000,000,000 users watching video content of various kinds on a daily
  basis.&nbsp; What's more, YouTube videos are being reached by the 18&#8211;49 target age-range &#8212; which, most of the online marketers are on the hunt
  for.
</p>
<p>
  Taking into account, the extraordinary popularity of YouTube videos amongst millions of users, both world-known brands and mom-and-pop companies have started
  investing into YouTube advertisements &#8212; as well as launching their own YouTube channels, featuring tutorials, bringing value to their customers,
  reviews, entertaining stuff, and/or merely highlights of memorable company events.&nbsp;
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-template-monster" rel="me" title="Template Monster">TemplateMonster</a> also doesn't lag behind the trends and
  updates their YouTube channel with valuable pieces of video content, every now-and-again.
</p>
<p>
  Put plainly, the reasons why videos are indispensable for the success of your online marketing campaign, are as below:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A video breaks-down corporate walls, referring to consumers as friends.
    </li>
    <li>
      A video leaves less room for misinterpretation.
    </li>
    <li>
      A video shows a product in action &#8212; revealing, in what ways, it can benefit their lives.
    </li>
    <li>
      People enjoy video content more than print.
    </li>
    <li>
      Videos let customers feel like they're participating in an active relationship with the brands that they enjoy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Videos visualize the marketing intent.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Even if you run a small company, and you don't have the budget for an Oscar-winning movie, record short video clips &#8212; revealing your company
  story.&nbsp; Introduce people to your employees and/or loyal fans.&nbsp; Get inspired by the way that trend-setters use visual stories in their marketing
  campaigns &#8212; considering, in what ways, you can do the same.
