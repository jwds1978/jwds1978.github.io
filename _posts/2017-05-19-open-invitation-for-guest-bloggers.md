      cited.
    </li>
    <li>

      and/or share it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Copyright:</span>&nbsp; You must be the original author, or an agent of its author with their full authority to assign
      any rights.&nbsp; You agree that all submissions, uon their submission, become the sole property of James Stewart.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Editing:</span>&nbsp; Any submission (i.e. copy, media, title, etc.) may be modified, as desired and/or needed and/or
      required, at my sole discretion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Hyperlinks:</span>&nbsp; No affiliate and/or referral links.&nbsp; No illegal and/or restricted &#8212; including, but
      not limited to, beastiality, child pornography, illicit drugs, incest, rape, etc. &#8212; content.&nbsp; No self-promotion.&nbsp; Don't overload your
      posting with hyperlinks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Language:</span>&nbsp; English.&nbsp; All submissions must be in English only &#8212; other languages will be rejected.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">SEO:</span>&nbsp; If you work for a content farm and/or are a freelancer, who writes with the sole intent of linking
      keywords in an effort to boost SEO, don't bother.&nbsp; Don't bother wasting your time nor mine.
    </li>

      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Tone:</span>&nbsp; Accessible, inclusive, and overall positive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Word Count:</span>&nbsp; Ideally, you'd want to hover around 1,000 or so words.&nbsp; However, it is what it is.&nbsp;
      While your focus should be on quality rather than quantity, and there's no official minimum count, all submissions should be no less than 250 words
      anyhow.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This Web site's maintained by only a handful, namely myself, of people.&nbsp; Given that, it's not possible to personally respond to all submissions.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, at times, we simply don't have the time &#8212; each day only has so many hours in it.&nbsp; Should your submission be accepted, generally
  speaking, you'll receive a response within 7 days.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to reading your submission&hellip;&nbsp; And, thank you, very much!
</p>
