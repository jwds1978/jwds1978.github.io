title: "Hilariously Terrible Stock Photos Miss the Mark Portraying Real Troops"
---

<p>
  Stock photos are a great resource for a lot of people and organizations who want to convey the right message, feeling, and/or image but can't get a photograph
  of their own.&nbsp; A story and/or advertisement about an elementary school, for example, may make use of a great stock image of children having fun while
  learning in a bright and colourful classroom &#8212; rather than having to set-up a photo session at a nearby school and get all the necessary permissions and
  arrangements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when it comes to stock photos of the military though, there are a lot of images that miss the mark &#8212; completely.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, they don't just miss the mark, they miss the whole target &#8212; and, sometimes, may not even be at the right shooting range.&nbsp; These rather
  poorly executed photos, do an injustice to our brave men and women in the military, and can completely misrepresent what our military is and looks like.&nbsp;
  But, quite frankly, a lot of these stock photos are just so bad at accurately depicting the military that we just have to laugh at them!

  Here's a collection of, some of the best, bad &quot;military&quot; stock images out there.

    &nbsp;<br />
    Let's start with an easy one here&hellip;&nbsp; It's two men in uniform, who are supposed to be drone operators.&nbsp; The facial hair of the man on the
    right would never be allowed in the Forces.&nbsp; Next, there's the complete lack of any name, rank, and/or service insignias.&nbsp; Collars up is a mistake
    as well.&nbsp; Lastly, I hope that I'd never see a drone operator looking so damn confused!<br />

    In this stock photo, a group of recruits are being yelled at by their instructor.&nbsp; For some unknown reason, the recruits and the instructor are in
    differing uniforms.&nbsp; There's also the bad hair cuts that would mean trouble for the life of any recruit.&nbsp; And, again, we see various types of
    facial hair &#8212; from a full beard on the instructor to the guy who hasn't shaved in a couple of days.<br />

    This 360&deg; stock image of a soldier is just bad &#8212; all of the way around.&nbsp; Let's start from the bottom; working upward.&nbsp; The boots that
    he's wearing &#8212; without his pants tucked-in &#8212; are nowhere close to military issue.&nbsp; Then, there's his actual fatigues.&nbsp; All of that
    gear strapped to him might be nice for carrying lots and lots of stuff, but it's mismatched and out of place &#8212; overdone, and just plain wrong.&nbsp;
    No name and/or service insignias are visible.&nbsp; To top it off, there's the headset &#8212; from his other job as a telemarketer &#8212; that he'd
    forgotten to remove.&nbsp; The finger on the trigger's a nice way to shoot someone's foot off too.<br />

        style="border: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482" /></a><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This &quot;American soldier&quot;, certainly, shows a lot of enthusiasm for his service.&nbsp; However, it's easy to see without looking too hard &#8212;
    don't look too hard &#8212; that it's all a bit over the top.&nbsp; We see bags on top of bags on top of bags&hellip;&nbsp; My personal favourite, is the
    fanny pack.&nbsp; Are those ski goggles?&nbsp; And, why's he unshaven?&nbsp; This one came close to the mark, but then it took a few leaps over the
    line.&nbsp; All that he's really missing, is a cape blowing in the wind behind him.<br />

    &nbsp;<br />
    This stock image of three soldiers, might look pretty hardcore at a glimpse, but this one's really just ridiculous.&nbsp; From the bad face painting &#8212;
    mismatched with the guy on the right &#8212; to the haphazardly rolled sleeves, on what may or may not be actual military fatigues, these guys are more than
    likely the kings of the local paintball range&hellip;&nbsp; That's about it though.&nbsp; No insignias, the cover of the left is just plain wrong, and the
    lack of co-ordination between what any of them are wearing is ridiculous.&nbsp; Our troops are as tough as they come &#8212; they don't need a caricature to
    make them seem any tougher.<br />

    This one had to come in first place, because it's just too awful for words.&nbsp; This is supposed to show a female soldier who's also a mother.&nbsp; But,
    how could the photographer think that this was even a remotely good idea?&nbsp; When did the Forces switch to tank tops and leggings instead of
    fatigues?&nbsp; They aren't even the same camo pattern!&nbsp; And, from the way that she's holding the rifle, it's doubtful that this model has ever held a
    firearm before.&nbsp; Is this really how we want to portray female troops?&nbsp; I don't know whether to laugh and/or scream&hellip;&nbsp; You decide.
