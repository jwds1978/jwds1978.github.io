title: "Comments for Blog Posts"
---

I've used private Git repositories for my professional development since forever. However, I've generally used WordPress for blogs though.

Going forward, I'll be sticking with GitHub. I'm interested in messing around with Jekyll, for my Web site(s), specifically. Although I have hosting services elsewhere, with hundreds of GB of space and an erroneous amount of bandwidth, I'll be purchasing a subscription with GitHub. Once I've got a paid account, I'll start migrating my private repositories to GitHub.

Getting back on topic, Ive been messing around with various comment options for GitHub-hosted blogs. Although I'd like to urilize GitHub-hosted comments, with respect to automation, that doesn't seem too partocularly feasible for me. I'm a very mobile person, and have always done the vast majority of my work from my mobile device(s). I just use a keyboard, mouse, and/or cast to a display if I've got a lot to do.

For me, it has always worked great. I can do whatever I need to, from wherever I may be. With that said, I'm having some trouble finding a decent Git client for Android that would play nice with the needed hooks for GitHub-hosted comments. More than likely, I'll just say 'fuck it' and go for some other drop-in comment solution&hellip; for now.
