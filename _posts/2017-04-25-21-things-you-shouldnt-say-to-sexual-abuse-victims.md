<p>
  I've heard my share of insensitive comments.&nbsp; I've also talked to enough victims to be able to gather some of the most damaging words here &#8212; for
  the sake of those who truly want to be helpful, loving, and sensitive.
</p>
<p>
  My intent for writing this article isn't to shame those who want to help and/or to make them walk on eggshells.&nbsp; Rather, it's to help friends and family
  members of victims, best love and understand, the journey that is sexual abuse recovery.
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li>
    It was so long ago&hellip;&nbsp; Why can't you just get over it?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        In this case, I'd simply ask, &quot;How long did it take you to 'get over' the death of a loved one?&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; Sexual abuse involves grief
        &#8212; the loss of innocence, the shame of sexual violation, the removing of living life free.&nbsp; I'm not certain that one ever does &quot;get over
        it&quot;.&nbsp; They grow&hellip;&nbsp; They heal&hellip;&nbsp; They process.&nbsp; But, there will always be that grief though.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Are you sure that it even happened?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Telling is the hardest thing to do for a sexual abuse victim.&nbsp; While there are people who make-up stories, err on the side of belief.&nbsp; Believe
        me, nobody wishes that they had this terrible story to tell.&nbsp; And yes, they're sure that it happened.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you talk about it so much, you'll never heal.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Processing is important.&nbsp; There will be times when a victim spends a lot of time talking.&nbsp; This, is part of the process.&nbsp; It won't always
        be so.&nbsp; Offer your understanding&hellip;&nbsp; Listen&hellip;&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Making snap judgments about someone's healing journey and
        how long that it &quot;should&quot; take only makes them want to quit.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    You know that song, &quot;What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&quot;?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Or &#8212; it makes you jumpy, less trusting, more fearful, and/or weaker.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I could never go through what you went through.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        What this communicates is that, in a way, you're glad that it didn't happen to you.&nbsp; Which, is completely natural for one to feel.&nbsp; However,
        it also makes victims feel like they're somehow marked &#8212; they're left with the, very real, truth that it did happen to them.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    That perpetrator must live with such awful regret.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Perhaps&helip;&nbsp; Perhaps, not.&nbsp; Sociopaths and psychopaths don't process regret and/or shame like others do.&nbsp; They tend to blame society,
        their upbringing, and even the victim themselves for their violations.&nbsp; A sexual predator may be redeemable, but their pathway to health is long
        and excruciating.&nbsp; There's

          one article
        </a>,
        that truly, helped me to understand how many predators process &quot;getting caught&quot;.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    That's how men act&hellip;&nbsp; It's normal.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        This is one of the most demeaning things that anyone could ever say about a man.&nbsp; Men aren't enslaved to sexual desire &#8212; unless, they choose
        to be.&nbsp; We can act nobly, honouring the women in our lives.&nbsp; We'll not die without sexual release.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    So-and-so forgave her abuser&hellip;&nbsp; It was easy.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        While forgiveness is an important part of the healing process, it's neither simple nor easy.&nbsp; Moreover, it can take years to get to a place where
        you choose to forgive.&nbsp; Telling victims how easy it was for someone else makes them feel like the path of healing that they're on is the wrong one.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    It's just sex.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Unwanted sexual touch is violation&hellip;&nbsp; It's not just sex.&nbsp; That's why there's a difference between consensual and non-consensual
        sex.&nbsp; One is an act of choice and/or love&hellip;&nbsp; The other, is predatory and criminal.

    </ul>

    But, was it full sexual abuse?&nbsp; He just leered?&nbsp; That's it?

          title="The Wounded Heart: Hope for Adult Victims of Childhood Sexual Abuse">
          The Wounded Heart
        </a>, shares that healing from sexual abuse is difficult &#8212; no matter, what form it takes.&nbsp; Don't minimize someone's journey just because it
        doesn't fit-in with your idea of violaton.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Was the perpetrator drunk?&nbsp; Were you?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        The fact is this&hellip;&nbsp; One person chose to violate the will and dishonour the &quot;no&quot; of another.&nbsp; This is a criminal act &#8212;
        regardless, of the state of inebriation.&nbsp; If someone murdered another while drunk, that state of drunkenness doesn't excuse the crime.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Well, what were you wearing?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Sexual predators prey on people, regardless of what they're wearing.&nbsp; Women are assaulted when they're just 5-years of age &#8212; wearing a
        kindergartener's dress, corduroy, with pants underneath and patent leather shoes.&nbsp; Such a question is, simply, ridiculous.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Did you flirt?&nbsp; What did you expect?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Flirting is quite different than asking to be violated.&nbsp; In the case of date rape, it makes sense that flirting went on because it was a
        &quot;date&quot;.&nbsp; However, a date alone isn't a precursor to unwanted sexual touch.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Why didn't you tell me before?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        This isn't about you&hellip;&nbsp; It's about the victim.&nbsp; Don't place a guilt trip on someone if it's taken her a long time to tell you.&nbsp;
        Telling is a huge risk.&nbsp; Many people are violated a second time, because the people they tell don't believe them, blame them, and/or flat-out walk
        away.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Hmm&hellip;&nbsp; But, you look normal.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Looks can be somewhat deceiving.&nbsp; Inside the mind of a sexual abuse victim is all sorts of chaos, shame, and/or worry that the secret will define
        them for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; They may look &quot;normal&quot;, but they struggle to heal &#8212; to believe, that they're worthy, to take-up
        space on this Earth.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Just stop thinking about it.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Flashbacks and triggers happen when a person may least expect it.&nbsp; Many victims suffer from PTSD and can't control the sudden thoughts that invade.

  <li>
    It could have been worse&hellip;&nbsp; [Insert a Worse Sexual Abuse Story Here]
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        This isn't helpful.&nbsp; Everybody has a unique story, and no matter what the level of sexual abuse, it's very real and hurtful to each
        individual.&nbsp; Don't try to minimize one person's story by sharing another.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Oh; I understand totally.&nbsp; [No, you don't.]
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Unless you've walked the sexual abuse path, don't say this.&nbsp; And, even if you have, no two people will process their abuse and/or heal in the same
        way.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    You sure that you didn't make this up to get attention?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        This is demeaning and utterly dismissive.&nbsp; Err on the side of belief, and empathy, rather than misinformed judgment.

  <li>
    Well, why didn't you [Insert Thing You Should've Done Here]?
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        Nobody can walk in the abuse victim's shoes.&nbsp; Nobody knows, exactly, what could or couldn't have been done.&nbsp; In the middle of violation, most
        victims are so typically shocked and taken off-guard that there's really no way to have a &quot;right&quot; reaction.&nbsp; Besides, the abuse happened,
        and saying there had been a way for the victim to escape is just heaping further shame.

    </ul>

  <li>
    This was part of God's plan.&nbsp; So, you'll have to make your peace with it.

      <li>
        I don't really even know how to respond to this.&nbsp; Even if somebody has a strong belief in the sovereignty of God, they must be honest &#8212;
        they'd still wrestle with why He didn't protect someone as a small child.&nbsp; I know as a parent, that if I knew my child was being exploited, I'd
        have stepped in.&nbsp; So, one may still wrestle with God's ways, and I think they always would.&nbsp; They'd still love Him&hellip;&nbsp; They'd still
        be, utterly, grateful for the healing He's wrought.&nbsp; However, they'd not really understand why they weren't protected.

  proved too risky for publishers.&nbsp; So, it was crowdfunded &#8212; which, turned-out to be an amazing success.&nbsp; What's unique about the book, is that
  it's written from the perspective of a survivor.&nbsp; It doesn't offer clich&eacute; answers&hellip;&nbsp; It's honest&hellip;&nbsp; And, the author's
  husband shared his unique journey of how to walk a loved one through their sexual abuse.
