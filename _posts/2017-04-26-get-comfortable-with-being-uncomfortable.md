<p>
  I've been an entrepreneur for several years.&nbsp; Midway through last year, things were coming to a head.&nbsp; I wasn't getting enough sleep&hellip;&nbsp; I
  wasn't exercising&hellip;&nbsp; I wasn't keeping my mind clear with meditation.
</p>
<p>
  In the middle of, what felt like the most stressful month of my life, my most senior officer stealthily forced me out of my own corporation.&nbsp; While I was
  complaining about the debacle to an entrepreneur friend of mine, he called my ass out:
  <blockquote>
    Get comfortable with the feeling that you have right now.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Somewhat confused, I asked, &quot;what feeling?&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; He replied:
  <blockquote>
    Feeling uncomfortable.&nbsp; Get comfortable, feeling uncomfortable.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  He stopped me right in my fucking tracks&hellip;&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; We all need to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable&hellip;&nbsp; We're
  too damn soft!&nbsp; I was a tough-as-nails mother-fucker, while in the service, and was starting to get fucking soft&hellip;&nbsp; Ugh!
</p>
<p>
  Here are 7 ways to get comfortable with being uncomfortable:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      Start
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          The first step is always the most uncomfortable&hellip;&nbsp; All you have to do is show up.&nbsp; The battle is half-won if you just show up.&nbsp; I
          get it &#8212; it's uncomfortable to start something.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If possible, make the decision to start on your own rather than have someone make that decision for you.&nbsp; Once you start, you're going to want to
          quit immediately.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Whenever you start something, it sucks.&nbsp; You start a diet &#8212; it sucks.&nbsp; You start working out &#8212; it sucks.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Remind yourself that you made a decision.&nbsp; You're already committed &#8212; there's no going back.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't quit.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          You've decided to start.&nbsp; You're not seeing results.&nbsp; It's difficult.&nbsp; You want to quit.&nbsp; It's OK.&nbsp; Just keep pushing
          forward.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          You're going to start thinking of a way out, where you can quit, and save face.&nbsp; Don't do it.&nbsp; Don't give yourself an out&hellip;&nbsp;
          Just, don't.&nbsp; Don't give yourself any options.&nbsp; Either you succeed or you fail.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          No fucking excuses.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The point when you're just about to give up is the precise moment when the other guy gives up.&nbsp; At some point, you're going to ask yourself,
          &quot;why am I doing this?&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; You'd better have an answer.&nbsp; What's driving you?&nbsp; Is it something someone said and/or did to
          you?&nbsp; Is it a competition?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Is it a challenge?&nbsp; Is it something that you have to prove to yourself?&nbsp; Is it just pride?&nbsp; Whatever it is, it had better be powerful.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Push yourself past your comfort zone.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          At some point, you're going to say to yourself, &quot;I've never done this before&quot; and/or &quot;I don't know what I'm doing&quot;.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We've all been there.&nbsp; Here's a trick&hellip;&nbsp; Don't say it out loud.&nbsp; Just pretend to be confident&hellip;&nbsp; Fake it, 'til you
          make it.&nbsp; It's scary, but I promise you this&hellip;&nbsp; When it's over, you're going to say, &quot;it wasn't as bad as I thought it
          was&quot;.&nbsp; Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Embrace &quot;the suck&quot;.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          The situation is bad &#8212; deal with it.&nbsp; And, don't just deal with it &#8212; open your arms and welcome it, as you would an old friend.&nbsp;
          You know him well.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, he shows up.&nbsp; &quot;The suck&quot; is here to make you tougher.&nbsp; He's a friend that
          arrived to make you better.&nbsp; Instead of complaining, celebrate the blessing that is &quot;the suck&quot;.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you're embracing &quot;the suck&quot; by yourself, laugh at how ridiculous the situation is.&nbsp; You're building your mental and physical
          toughness points.&nbsp; If you're embracing the suck with others, you've just made new best friends for life.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Embracing &quot;the suck&quot; within a group is a powerful bonding experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Be around like-mided people.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Create a support network.&nbsp; Talk about your experiences.&nbsp; The worse the experience is to you, the better the story is to everyone else.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Soon, you'll be seeking uncomfortable experiences to share with your friends.&nbsp; Be a good story-teller.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Recognize your improvements.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          Track your progress&hellip;&nbsp; Revel in it.&nbsp; You're now a changed person.&nbsp; You know it, because you see it.&nbsp; Build your confidence
          by going back to what, before was uncomfortable, and go through the experience again.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          You're seeing your progress in real-time.&nbsp; By nature, you're going to want to push the envelope to find out your boundaries.&nbsp; You'll find
          yourself saying, &quot;I wish it would suck more&quot;.&nbsp; It's our human nature to know what we're able to overcome.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Rinse&hellip;&nbsp; Repeat.
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
          There's an old Russian saying, &quot;povtorenie mat ucheniya&quot;, which means &quot;repetition is the mother of learning&quot;.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The more that you perform the same activity, the more confident you become.&nbsp; Confidence is a tangible thing &#8212; it comes from practice and
          repetition.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
