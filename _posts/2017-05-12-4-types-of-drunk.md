<p>
  Are you a Mary Poppins or a Nutty Professor?&nbsp; These are the four different types of drunk, according to scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Everybody holds their booze in different ways, but apparently, all of us can be placed into specific drunken personality types.&nbsp; Researchers, from the
  University of Missouri, grilled 187 students about their tipsy and sober states &#8212; sorting them into groups.
</p>
<p>
  Members of the group were then paired up into &quot;drinking buddies&quot; because they knew what each other were like on a night out.&nbsp; The experts then
  came up with the four most common drunk personalities &#8212; and named them all after familiar pop culture references.
</p>
<p>
  Intrigued?&nbsp; Here are the four types of drunk&hellip;

  The Hemingway
</h3>
<p>
  Hemingway's were the most common drunk personality &#8212; with 42% of the participants falling into this category.
</p>
<p>
  Novelist, Ernest Hemingway, is quoted as once saying that he could &quot;drink Hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk&quot;.&nbsp; Just like the
  namesake, this &quot;type&quot; stays pretty much the same while out on a bender.
</p>
<p>
  Hemingways were described as &quot;drinkers who tend not to undergo drastic character changes or experience harms&quot;.&nbsp; However, it should be noted,
  that their levels of intellect and conscientiousness did drop a tad though.
</p>
<p>
  So, while they're not wildly different, they're not on their &quot;A&quot; game either.&nbsp; This is the most common drunk personality &#8212; with 42% of
  the participants falling into this category.

<h3 id="mary-poppins">
  Mary Poppins
</h3>
<p>
  Mary Poppins types are sweet and friendly.
</p>
<p>
  When you think of Mary Poppins, what do you envisage?&nbsp; Well, this drunk's just how you imagine &#8212; sweet and, generally, agreeable.
</p>
<p>
  The Mary Poppins persona stays nice and friendly, and is unlikely to stir up any trouble, despite having knocked back a few.&nbsp; However, they too, will act
  a bit less intelligently and conscientiously.

<h3 id="the-nutty-professor">
  The Nutty Professor
</h3>
<p>
  Nutty Professors have lively alter egos.
</p>
<p>
  Just like Eddie Murphy's famous character, this drunk reveals a second personality, which comes when they're under the influence.&nbsp; Nutty Professors tend
  to be quiet folk when they're sober, but become the life and the soul of the party, once the drinks start flowing.&nbsp; As the booze kicks in, these
  characters lose their inhibitions, and start to show-off their louder &#8212; much less, self-disciplined &#8212; side.

<h3 id="the-mr-hyde">
  The Mr. Hyde
</h3>
<p>
  Mr. Hyde types have a dark side.
</p>
<p>
  Everybody knows a &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot; type.&nbsp; They're, generally, the person that you want to watch out for when they're boozed.&nbsp; Dr. Jekyll's famed
  for having an evil alter ego, called Mr. Hyde &#8212; and, this drinker has a dark side when they hit the bottle.
</p>
<p>
  A Mr. Hyde drunk acts &quot;particularly less responsible, less intellectual, and more hostile, when under the influence of alcohol&quot;.&nbsp; Combined with
  the fact that their levels of conscientiousness, intellect, and agreeableness sharply drop, you may want to keep your distance from any drunken Mr. Hyde
  pals&hellip;
