<p>
  The next time that you pass a homeless person on the street, remind yourself that they could be a Forces veteran.&nbsp; There's a very real possibility that
  this man or woman has served our country &#8212; they may have put themselves in harm's way, in defence of Canada, and/or in an effort to bring peace to
  another country.
</p>
<p>
  Within the United States, 1 in 4 people living on the streets, is a veteran.&nbsp; The statistics for Canada are unknown, but it's estimated that there's
  likely to be tens of thousands of veterans living/sleeping rough &#8212; either on the streets and/or in the bush &#8212; under extremely adverse conditions
  and in abject poverty.&nbsp; These hardships are exacerbated by mental illness, as well as drug and alcohol abuse, and by Canada's extreme winter weather.

  Jason Duprau, art director of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-legion-magazine" rel="me" title="Legion Magazine">Legion Magazine</a>, asked Janice
  Kun to create these haunting illustrations to accompany an article on homeless war veterans and how Canada's approaching the problem.
</p>
<p>
  Joanne Henderson, Legion service officer, in Vancouver:
  <blockquote>
    Nobody knows the number of homeless veterans in Canada, and this is one of the reasons why:<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Aside from struggling with issues of addiction and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a lot of them don't want to be identified as veterans.&nbsp; Some
    don't want their buddies to find out what's happened to them.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They think back to their time in the services as the good times in their lives and they're ashamed.&nbsp; They think they should be able to take care of
    themselves.&nbsp; They're in hiding; they're hiding from themselves.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    It's not enough to ask &quot;are you a veteran&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; We learned you have to ask &quot;did you have any military service&quot; because many
    don't feel like veterans &#8212; they think veterans are guys from World War Two.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  One of the solutions that is proving very successful is <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-cockrell-house-provides-a-home-for-veterans-in-transition" rel="me"
    title="Cockrell House provides a home for veterans in transition">Cockrell House</a> in Colwood, British Columbia.&nbsp; Much more than just housing, it's a
  full program that expects residents to move out and into more permanent accommodations within two years &#8212; helping them develop the life skills which
  they need to do that.
</p>
<p>
  &quot;It's a hand up, not a hand out&quot;, says Dave Sinclair, President of British Columbia/Yukon Command, which helped to fund Cockrell House.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Myself, I've recently found myself homeless for yet another time in my life.&nbsp; I, absolutely, houldn't be in the position that I am at the moment.&nbsp;
  I've been sleeping outside, in the streets, using cardboard as shelter &#8212; in sub-zero and cold/wet weather, at times &#8212; for some weeks now.&nbsp;
  I'm waiting for my social assistance (i.e. Ontario Disability Support Program, Ontario Works, etc.) to get unfucked &#8212; I'venot received a single fucking
  cent for the month of May.&nbsp; As such, I can't pay rent, and am relying upon places such as <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-elgin-street-mission" rel="me" title="The Elgin Street Mission">The Mission</a> in order to eat.&nbsp; Some
  days, I'm able to get 2 meals from them.&nbsp; However, most days, I eat only once per day &#8212; during their supper meal time in the evening.
