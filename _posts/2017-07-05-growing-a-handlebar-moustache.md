  I've been growing-in a beard over recent months&hellip;&nbsp; Additionally, I've not shaved my moustache either.&nbsp; My intent's to keep growing my beard
  and 'stache.&nbsp; Ultimately, the pinnacle, will be a rather distinguished &quot;handlebar&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Thus far, it's coming along quite nicely.&nbsp; My moustache is about ready to start waxing&hellip;&nbsp; I'm, currently, filtering my drink/food.&nbsp; Over
  the next few weeks, at some point, I'll pick-up some moustache wax.&nbsp; While I'd prefer somewhere local to walk-out with it in-hand, I may just order from
  Amazon.&nbsp; Realistically, I'd more than likely get a better quality product and at a cheaper price than locally anyhow.

  The handlebar moustache is characterized by long and upward-curving ends (i.e. extremities).&nbsp; The name, handlebar, is derived from the resemblance of the
  moustache to the handles found upon the bicycles.&nbsp; Handlebar moustaches are sometimes referred to as spaghetti moustaches.&nbsp; The name, spaghetti
  moustache, is due to its association &#8212; stereotypically &#8212; with Italian men.
</p>
<p>
  Handlebar moustaches are made possible by the use of moustache wax, making the extremities of the handlebar moustache &#8212; the greater the dramatic
  appearance that's achieved, the better.
</p>
<p>

  The majority of handlebar experts would say that you'd need a bare minimum of, at least, 1&frac12; months of growth before your 'stache is long enough to be
  styled into the correct handlebar shape.&nbsp; However, you'll need to start training your moustache now though, in order to achieve that most glorious of
  forms.&nbsp; Personally, I've been training it by combing it several times throughout the day &#8212; getting it wanting to grow in a certain way.

  Don't trim it!&nbsp; No matter how tempting it is, don't trim your moustache &#8212; ever.

</p>
<p>
  When your moustache's long enough to comb, comb it once per day.&nbsp; Create a part by combing the hair, out from under the nose to the left and to the
  right, respectively.&nbsp; This will train your 'stache to grow-out in the traditional handlebar fashion.&nbsp; A simple comb will do the trick.&nbsp; If you
  want to get fancy, go with a wooden moustache comb.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="step-3-wax-it">
  Step <sup>#</sup>3 &#8212; Wax It
</h3>

</p>
<p>
  After getting out of the shower, leave your moustache damp.&nbsp; Starting in the middle of your lip, apply a small dab of moustache wax with your fingertip
  to the upper-edge, and use a comb to spread it down throughout the hair.&nbsp; Work your way out to each end, applying more wax, as needed.&nbsp; If your
  moustache happens to be somewhat wiry, use more wax.
</p>

    style="border: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="425" />
</p>
<p>
  To add that distinctive handlebar curl, apply some wax to the ends, twisting the hairs together with your fingers.&nbsp; Then curl the twisted hair up and
  in.&nbsp; You can also create a curl by winding the ends as tightly as possible around a writing pen.

<p>
  Owning a handlebar moustache's a commitment&hellip;&nbsp; You have to wash it, comb it, wax it, and curl it &#8212; every day.&nbsp; However, should the day
  arrive that you have to take part in a bare-knuckle boxing match, the investment will be well worth it.
