  A couple of days ago, I'd posted an article about

    veteran homelessness in Canada
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  To be perfectly honest, I've recently come to find myself homeless&hellip;&nbsp; And, not for the first time in my life either.&nbsp; However, the last
  time was quite some years ago though.&nbsp; In fact, I've been living on the street since around about 16 April 2017.&nbsp; I've been staying off-and-on at
  the Off the Street Emergency Shelter since it opened in November 2016.&nbsp; However, they closed for the season, in mid-April.&nbsp; Given that, I'm now out
  on the street.&nbsp; While I wouldn't say that I'm particularly ashamed of the fact that I'm without a place to live, it's also not something that I generally
  let many know either&hellip;&nbsp; That is, until now, at least.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  It was fucking snowing, just a few days ago, but the city seems to think that's still warm enough to have closed the shelter when they did though.&nbsp; WTF,
  eh?&nbsp; I'd like to see one of those people, who have decision-making authortity within the Homelessness Network &#8212; or, WTFever it's called &#8212;
  stay outside for a mere 24-hour period when it's &lt;10&degC; let alone, sub-zero temperatures.
</p>
<p>
  While I'm Army, all the fucking way, and can &#8212; and, will &#8212; survive, it doesn't mean that I should fucking have to though.&nbsp; What the fuck kind
  of country are we, really, with the amount of homeless and/or poverty-stricken people?&nbsp; We can &#8212; we should &#8212; do fucking better&hellip;&nbsp;
  Especially, for our warriors.&nbsp; Our country breaks us, but then casually discards and forgets about us, once we're no longer &quot;serviceable&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  While it was, somewhat warm the one night, it's been sub-zero, or damn close to it, most nights.&nbsp; Given that, I've been humping my gimp ass
  back-and-forth between the Tim Hortons on Barrydowne &#8212; being the only 24-hour location that still allows people access in-store, without having to make
  use of the drive-thru &#8212; the library on Mackenzie, and the Mission on Elgin.&nbsp; While I'm actually surprised that this Tim Hortons locations hasn't
  pestered me for being here for several hours each night, I'm extremely grateful for being neither asked nor forced to leave.&nbsp; I try to buy some stuff
  throughout the night, but am more or less broke-as-fuck at the moment though.&nbsp; So, that's not a possibility most evenings.&nbsp; Although, not entirely
  certain, I believe that I'd nodded-off here for a few hours yesterday &#8212; my 2200 dose of pills is enough to sedate a fucking elephant and tend to knock
  me on my fucking ass&hellip;I can fight the effects for a short time, but eventually, they always win-out &#8212; they're supposed to help me sleep through
  the nights without waking with night terrors, and they knock me right the fuck out.&nbsp; However, even then, I wasn't disturbed nor was I asked to leave the
  premise.
</p>
<p>
  Although, it's not completed yet, have a look at <a href="{{ site.url }}/in-case-of-emergency" rel="me" title="In Case of Emergency">my ICE Web page</a>,
  should you be curious as to just how fucked-up I am.&nbsp; As mentioned, it's neither complete nor up-to-date, at the moment.&nbsp; But, you can get a slight
  idea as to the state of my health though.&nbsp; Essentially, the TL;DR is this&hellip;&nbsp; I'm fucked, and with each passing day, am finding myself worse
  off.&nbsp; Given that the page isn't completed, it doesn't quite communicate the gravity of my medical shit.&nbsp; However, as Medic Alert said to me, I'm
  one of their more complex patient files.
</p>
<p>
  Given my current situation, it's been several days since I've had a chance to remove my unloader brace.&nbsp; As such, I'm starting to get a number of sores
  and my leg's bleeding in several places.&nbsp; I've got to get it off for several hours tomorrow, at some point.&nbsp; Not only is my leg getting all sorts of
  more fucked-up, but the orthosis itself will start to deteriorate from lack of proper care.

  About Homelessness
</h3>
<p>
  Homelessness &#8212; simply defined &#8212; is the absence of a place to live.&nbsp; This can be a person who has no regular place to live, who stays in an
  overnight emergency shelter, abandoned building, all-night coffee shop or theatre, a car, outdoors, and/or other such places not meant to be living spaces.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Canada's response to homelessness remains based upon emergency accommodations and/or an uncoordinated use of public systems and/or services.&nbsp;
  There's, much more work to be done, in preventing homelessness from occurring in the first place.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="what-is-homelessness">
  What is Homelessness
</h3>
<p>
  Homelessness, simply defined, is the absence of a place to live.&nbsp; It's said, that approximately 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness each damn
  year.&nbsp; The number of homeless people, and the length of time that they spend homeless, continues to rise with each passing day.
</p>
<p>
  Contrary to what seems to be popular belief, homelessness isn't really a choice.&nbsp; In actuality, anyone can become homeless, at any given time.&nbsp;
  Although the root cause is poverty, underlying issues may include, but aren't limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A shortage of affordable housing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Abuse and/or violence within the home.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lack of employment and/or income.
    </li>
    <li>
      Poor mental and/or physical health.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>
  Who Experiences Homelessness
</h4>
<p>
  Canada's homeless population is incredibly diverse.&nbsp; The people on the streets represent, less than 20%, of the homeless population.&nbsp; As many as
  50,000 people make up the &quot;hidden&quot; homeless &#8212; individuals who, temporarily stay with family and/or friends, because they have nowhere else to
  go.
</p>
<p>
  Families with children are the fastest growing homeless demographic.&nbsp; And, that number's only expected to grow.&nbsp; Over 10% of Canadian families,
  currently, live below the low-income cut-off &#8212; unable to meet even the most basic of needs.
</p>
<p>
  Canada's also witnessing a staggering rise in homeless youth.&nbsp; In the past 25 years, there's been a 450% increase in the number of youth shelter beds in
  Toronto alone.&nbsp; Many of these young people are fleeing dangerous situations &#8212; 61% of homeless youth report being physically and/or sexually abused
  by an adult at some point in their lives.&nbsp; Studies show that youth who stay on the street, for two years or more, are less likely to leave &#8212; making
  an intervention within the first two years key to solving the problem.

<h3 id="long-term-solutions">
  Long-Term Solutions
</h3>
<p>
  To accomplish this goal, the focus is on three distinct approaches:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Prevention
    </li>
    <li>
      Systems Response
    </li>
    <li>
      Early Intervention
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Prevention
</h4>
<p>
  Prevention minimizes entry into homelessness and reduces the amount of time that individuals spend homeless.&nbsp; Homelessness prevention consists of three
  intersecting principles:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Primary Prevention:</span>&nbsp; An &quot;upstream&quot; approach that targets groups who are at-risk of becoming
      homeless &#8212; due to factors such as abuse, addiction, and/or unemployment.&nbsp; This model minimizes entry into homelessness by offering targeted
      awareness campaigns and/or support.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Secondary Prevention:</span>&nbsp; Addresses the early stages of homelessness by helping people retain their housing
      and/or find new accommodations.&nbsp; This is, generally, done through mediation with landlords and/or families.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Tertiary Prevention:</span>&nbsp; Prevents recurring homelessness by offering on-going support once housing has been
      established.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Systems Response
</h4>
<p>
  A systems response to homelessness, aims to streamline services, providing families with joint access to all necessary supports &#8212; addictions care,
  employment services, housing support, mental health, etc.&nbsp; Working, collaboratively, allows organizations to share information &#8212; providing
  consistent care and minimizing duplication of services.&nbsp; A systems response provides a &quot;no wrong door&quot; approach &#8212; meaning, individuals
  and/or families can access all of the services, regardless of where they enter the system.&nbsp; This leads to an increased sense of stability and greater
  opportunities for community participation, education, and/or training.
</p>
<p>
  A Systems Response involves two types of integration:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Horizontal Integration</span>&nbsp; A centralized approach between organizations that can occur at many levels.&nbsp;
      Horizontal integration, typically, requires a top-down meets bottom-up approach.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Vertical Integration</span>&nbsp; A centralized approach, in which, departments within an organization coordinate
      processes in order to ensure the seamless delivery of care.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Housing First as Early Intervention
</h4>
<p>
  Housing first is a rights-based, recovery-oriented, approach that focuses on getting people into housing as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Under this model,
  support services are introduced after the individual's housed &#8212; thus, preventing further episodes of homelessness.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike other re-housing methods, housing first doesn't require participants to meet certain behavioural and/or treatment expectations.&nbsp; It's rooted in
  the philosophy that housing is a right and a pre-condition for recovery.&nbsp; Studies show that having a home can bring substantial benefits, by providing
  stability, and helping to develop self-worth.
</p>
<p>
  The concept of housing first originated in the 1970s, with the development of programs like Pathways to Housing in New York, which focused on re-housing
  people with severe addictions and/or mental health issues.&nbsp; In 2009, the Mental Health Commission of Canada introduced the At Home/Chez Soi
  initiative&hellip;&nbsp; The first step in solidifying housing first, as an approach to homelessness, in Canada.&nbsp; This 5-year, pilot project, evaluated
  the effectiveness of housing first in four cities &#8212; Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.&nbsp; The results have been, overwhelmingly,
  positive.&nbsp; Housing first has been effective in maintaining housing for adults with mental illness and substance abuse issues.
