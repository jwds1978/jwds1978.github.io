<p>
  It takes the heart of a warrior to find deception and take it down.
</p>
<p>
  It starts off simple enough&hellip;&nbsp; A casual mention of military service.&nbsp; And, oh by the way, a Victoria Cross and a few other honours
  earned.&nbsp; How can you not trust a person who served their country so gallantly?
</p>
<p>
  From there, confidence builds.&nbsp; One story weaves into even more glorious tales, until&hellip;&nbsp; At some point, the fabrication is woven so tightly
  that you begin to suspect.
</p>
<p>
  How can one person achieve so much in such a short time?&nbsp; It's almost too good to be true&hellip;
</p>
<!--excerptBreak-->
<p>
  While this seems to be an isue more prevalent within the United States of America than here in Canada, we do have our share as well.&nbsp; The most recent of
  which readily comes to my mind is
  <a href="#cite-the-strange-case-of-franck-gervais-impersonating-a-soldier" rel="me" title="The Strange Case of Franck Gervais: Impersonating a Soldier">
    Franck Gervais
  </a>.&nbsp;
  Franck had never been in the military, yet he wore a military uniform to the Ottawa Remembrance Day ceremonies.&nbsp; Hell, he even gave a public interview on
  national television during the ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I don't much care if somebody makes false claims about military service&hellip;&nbsp; They're, usually, trying to pick-up a woman or some other
  shit.&nbsp; What I have a real issue with though, is somebody who is attempting to obtain some sort of financial gain (i.e. assistance, charity, discount,
  donation, etc.) based upon their service claim(s).&nbsp; Here in Sudbury alone, I've come across a Canadian seaman who was a Navy SEAL, a Canadian grunt who
  was in the Gulf but was stationed on a boat, a US Army secret-squirrel&#8212;spaceshuttle-door-gunner&#8212;special-forces, a guy who was in Iraq and had his
  buddy die in his arms after being fragged, and others.
</p>
<p>
  The guy who made the Navy SEAL claims, from what I gather from other local veterans, may have served with the merchant marines.&nbsp; However, quite clearly,
  is no SEAL.&nbsp; Another veteran had advised me that a contact within VAC told him that the guy has some service, but is full-of-shit about his SEAL claims
  though.&nbsp; I'd sent a message, via Facebook Messenger, to
  <a href="#cite-phony-navy-seals-verifications" rel="me" title="Phony Navy SEALs Verifications">Don Shipley</a> about this guy.&nbsp; But, I've yet to receive
  a response from Don.&nbsp; I guess, he has no real interest in Canadians that are passing themselves off as SEALs.&nbsp; I told this guy straight-out, if he
  was a Navy SEAL, than I was a fucking submarine door-gunner&hellip; And, that my Navy buddy, who was standing beside me at the time, had a screen door from
  one of our deisel subs for sale.
</p>
<p>
  The squid-grunt of the Gulf was originally introduced to me via a mutual friend.&nbsp; The mutual friend hasn't ever served, but introduced him to me though
  as he knew that I've served myself.&nbsp; I presented him with my veterean-designated platinum CFOne, regimental coin, veteran (poppy) license plates on my
  car, etc. and asked him for some proof-of-service.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Initially, he said that it was in a safe at home in his house&hellip;&nbsp; Entirely, plausible.&nbsp; However, I attended his home (which, is actually his
  mother's place) several times.&nbsp; I'd given him a ride home and picked him up, a few times, to have an excuse to be at his house.&nbsp; Whenever we were
  there though, he always had some sort of half-assed excuse to not be able to get to it at the time.&nbsp; Moreover, one time, he'd even made a point of
  specifically telling me to not make any mention of him having served in the Forces in front of his mother.&nbsp; Why would that be?&nbsp; Things that make you
  go, hmmm&hellip;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  I did some research into the ship that he said he was on&hellip;&nbsp; The USS Durham.&nbsp; Take note of the USS designator?&nbsp; He was supposedly
  stationed in Petawawa, but was posted to a US ship?&nbsp; He was in the Canadian Army, but posted to a US boat&hellip;&nbsp; Let that sink in for a
  moment.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Anyhow, the USS Durham was a Charleston class amphibious cargo ship.&nbsp; She served as a commissioned ship for 24 years and 9 months; earning a
  total of 15 awards and campaign ribbons for her service.&nbsp; In the Gulf War, she was part of an 18-ship amphibious task force.&nbsp; The largest such force
  since the Korean War.&nbsp; The task force arrived on station, in the North Arabian Sea, on 12 January 1991.&nbsp; The ship was decommissioned on 25 February
  1994.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  The Battle for Qurah and Umm al Maradim, were several naval and land battles for control over the islands off the coast of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf.&nbsp;
  Mainly, the islands of Qurah and Umm al Maradim.
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Qurah
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>
          Qurah was the first island to be retaken by Coalition Forces.&nbsp; On 24 January 1991, two A-6's destroyed an enemy minelayer, a minesweeper, and a
          patrol boat near Qurah Island.&nbsp; A second minesweeper was sunk when it ran into one of their own mines; trying to evade the A-6s.&nbsp;
          Helicopters from USS Curts flew over the wreckage to pick up Iraqi survivors and take them back as POWs.&nbsp; As they picked up the survivors, Iraqi
          troops on Qurah fired at the helicopters forcing them to fall back, managing to get twenty-two survivors out of the water.&nbsp; USS Curts maneuvered
          itself in a position so that it could fire on the island's defenses.&nbsp; This started a six-hour battle to retake the first parcel of Kuwaiti
          Territory.&nbsp; USS Leftwich landed US Navy SEALs on the island via helicopter, and by the time the gunfire had ceased, three Iraqi soldiers lay dead
          with fifty-one surrendering.&nbsp; There were no Coalition losses.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Umm al Maradim
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>
          On 29 January 1991, in the northern Persian Gulf, the five ships of Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) ALFA &#8212; USS Cayuga, USS Durham, USS Fort
          McHenry, USS Ogden, and USS Okinawa &#8212; steamed near the Kuwaiti island, Umm al Maradim.&nbsp; United States Marines assaulted the 300-meter by
          400-meter island, 12 miles off of the Kuwaiti coast, using embarked Marine helicopter.&nbsp; After several hours of intense combat, the Marines
          succeeded in liberating the second Kuwaiti island.&nbsp; After destroying Iraqi anti-aircraft weapons and artillery stored on the island, which had
          been used as an early warning post by the enemy, the Marines raised the Kuwaiti flag over the second parcel of reclaimed territory.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  I later learned from our mutual friend that this guy was some sort of mechanic.&nbsp; Apparently, he'd told my friend that he was shot several times while
  storming a beach-head during the Gulf war.&nbsp; WTF would a Canadian mechanic be doing posted to a US cargo ship, during a US Marine helicopter
  insertion?&nbsp; Dying to know the answer to such a question, I asked him myself about what our friend had told me.&nbsp; He told me the same, that he was
  stationed in Petawawa on-board the USS Durham.&nbsp; He even told me that he still had the belt buckle from the USS Durham.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  At this point, he proceeded to tell me the tale that he'd told our friend previously.&nbsp; While I don't recall the specifics, as I had no real interest in
  retaining what he was telling me, it went like something from Normandy days.&nbsp; He said that the USS Durham, amongst other ships in the fleet, stormed a
  beach-head in the Gulf.&nbsp; He said that the front of the ships opened up, and they ran out down the ramps, storming the beach.&nbsp; He says that he was
  shot while assualting the beach&hellip; He'd gotten hit several times while running across the beach or some fucking shit.&nbsp; How in the fuck does this
  super-soldier&#8212;mechanic&#8212;fast-moving-assaulter&#8212;squirrel not have a Victoria Cross?<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Eventually, I'd finally just said fuck it, and told him exactly what I thought of him.&nbsp; He then goes on to tell our mutual friend that his ID documents
  aren't actually in a safe at the house&hellip;&nbsp; They're, actually, in a locker at NDHQ in Ottawa.&nbsp; Seriously, dude?&nbsp; That's the best that he
  could come up with?&nbsp; He went on to tell us that when he got out of the Army, he went to NDHQ, walked in, told them to fuck off, and they gave him a
  locker to store his shit in permanently.&nbsp; He said that he just threw his uniform, documents, IDs, etc. into said locker, slammed it shut and stormed
  out.&nbsp; Like, WTF?&nbsp; That's not how this works&hellip;&nbsp; That's not how any of this fucking works.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  After I'd called him on his shit, he stopped coming around all of the regular places that I generally see him on an almost daily basis.&nbsp; I guess, having
  had his ass busted, he decided to stay clear going forward.
</p>
<p>
  A picklie (PPCLI) buddy of mine was in town, staying at the Salvation Army while passing through.&nbsp; He told me about the Iraq war hero.&nbsp; Given that
  he was staying there, and bunked with the guy, he asked me to come along one night and talk to him.&nbsp; So, I did.&nbsp; The guy was standing outside one
  night, having a smoke, when I was dropping my buddy off.&nbsp; We got out and he introduced me to the guy, making a point to point out my veteran (poppy)
  plates to the guy.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  I don't think it was even 30 seconds of the guy having opened his mouth, but he was already telling me about how his buddy died in his arms in Iraq.&nbsp; He
  told me that they'd been fragged, his buddy died in his arms from the resultant wounds, and he himself now has a plate in his skull from a huge-ass gaping
  hole that was opened up by said frag grenade.&nbsp; Wow, man; Rambo's got nothing on this fucking dude.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  So, to put this into perspective&hellip;
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      They come under fire.
    </li>
    <li>
      A fragmentation grenade explodes in their immediate vicinity.
    </li>
    <li>
      His buddy is mortally wounded; dying in his arms.
    </li>
    <li>
      While consoling his dying buddy, he's got a gaping hole in his skull with brain-matter exposed, but is still coherent enough to tend to his dying friend.
    </li>
    <li>
      He receives surgery, somewhere at some point, and a plate is put into his head.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a result of his injuries, he'd released as being unfit for service.
    </li>
  </ol>
  Amazed by this, I ask him why he's in the Salvation Army&hellip;&nbsp; Is he not in receipt of a long-term pension?&nbsp; He tells me that he got nothing when
  they released him.&nbsp; I asked him who he'd spoken with at VAC&hellip;&nbsp; He just gave me a blank stare and asked me what the VAC is.&nbsp; Like,
  WTF?&nbsp; FUcking cadets and weekend warriors know what Veterans Affairs Canada is.&nbsp; How the fuck does a regular force super hero not know of
  them?&nbsp; When I'd asked him that, he simply told me that nobody ever told him anything about Veterans Affairs and that he'd never heard of VAC before that
  day.&nbsp; He then, rather promptly, went inside and I never saw nor heard from him again.
