  Statement from, Chicago Blackhawks forward, Marian Hossa:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-medical-update-on-marian-hossa">
    Over the course of the last few years, under the supervision of the Blackhawks medical staff, I have been privately undergoing treatment for a progressive
    skin disorder and the side effects of the medications involved to treat the disorder.&nbsp; Due to the severe side effects associated with those
    medications, playing hockey is not possible for me during the upcoming 2017&#8211;18 season.&nbsp; While I am disappointed that I will not be able to play,
    I have to consider the severity of my condition and how the treatments have impacted my life both on and off the ice.

  Statement from Chicago Blackhawks Team Physician Dr. Michael Terry:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-medical-update-on-marian-hossa">
    Marian has been dealing with the effects of a progressive skin disorder that is becoming more and more difficult to treat and control with conventional
    medications while he plays hockey.&nbsp; Because of the dramatic nature of the medications required and their decreasing effectiveness, we strongly support
    his decision not to play during the 2017&#8211;18 season.&nbsp; We feel in the most certain terms this is the appropriate approach for Marian in order to
    keep him functional and healthy in the short term and throughout his life.
