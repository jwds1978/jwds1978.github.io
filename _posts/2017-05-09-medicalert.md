<p>
  I've, recently, had my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-medicalert-referral-program" rel="me" title="MedicAlert Referral Program">MedicAlert</a>
  subscription renewed.&nbsp; I've got a shit-load of medical issues and needed to have it replaced.&nbsp; I've been having more myoclonic episodes as of
  late.&nbsp; Given the amount of medications that I'm on and the severity of some of my medical problems, it could very well save my life one day.
</p>
<p>
  When you're helpless and/or hurt, your MedicAlert ID and membership, give paramedics the information that they need in order to save your life.&nbsp; Don't
  die of denial&hellip;&nbsp; A medical emergency could happen to you too.&nbsp; Get the same protection and peace of mind that I have by
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-medicalert-referral-program" rel="me" title="MedicAlert Referral Program">signing-up for MedicAlert</a>!&nbsp; For
  a discount and/or special offer when signing-up, be sure to use my referral code &#8212; &quot;JS17-1979&quot;.
