<p>
  As evidenced by <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-in-case-of-emergency-james-wd-stewart" rel="me"
    title="In Case of Emergency :: James W.D. Stewart">my medical record</a>, I've got some issues &#8212; mental and physical alike.&nbsp; I'd ignored, and
  soldiered-on through the pain, for several years.&nbsp; In recent years though, I've found it my health steadily worsening and I was forced to seek medical
  help.&nbsp; My mobility is getting worse with each passing month.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Up until a few years ago, I was self-medicating, with 15+ grams of over-the-counter Tylenol and a few joints, on a daily basis.&nbsp; Initially, I'd
  encountered resistance due to not having a family physician&hellip;&nbsp; Forcinf me to self-medicate for the pain.&nbsp; However, the pain got to the point
  where even that wasn't helping any longer&hellip;&nbsp; Forcing me to aggressively pursue medical relief.&nbsp; Over the last few years, I've been prescribed
  Kadian (morphine sulfate), Tramacet (acetaminophen, tramadol hydrochloride), and Tylenol with Codeine <sup>#</sup>3 (acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine).&nbsp;
  Below, are the last dosage that I was on of each of the aforementioned medications:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Kadian&nbsp; <sup>Morphine Sulfate (20 MG)</sup>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Daily
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bolder;">0700:</span>&nbsp; 1 Capsule
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bolder;">1700:</span>&nbsp; 1 Capsule
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Tramacet&nbsp; <sup>Acetaminophen (325 MG), Tramadol Hydrochloride (37&frac12; MG)</sup>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Daily
          <ul>
            <li>

  Not having a family physician, and having been registered with <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-health-care-connect" rel="me"
    title="Health Care Connect">Health Care Connect</a> for several years now, I'm left with no option other than seeking care from walk-in clinics.&nbsp; But,
  this presents a lot of problems though.&nbsp; Attending various random clinics, and seeing random doctors with each visit, doesn't allow for any kind of real
  care nor treatment.&nbsp; As such, for the entire time that I've been living in Sudbury, I've been going to the same clinic (<a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-northwood-medical-clinics" rel="me" title="Northwood Medical Clinics">Northwood Medical Clinics</a>) and utilizing
  the same pharmacy (<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-shoppers-drug-mart-frood-elm-shoppers-drug-mart" rel="me"
    title="Shoppers Drug Mart - Frood &amp; Elm | Shoppers Drug Mart">Shoppers Drug Mart</a>).&nbsp; I'd see one of the same several doctors &#8212; all of
  which, being at the same clinic, would have access to my medical records.
</p>
<p>
  I was, originally, attending the clinic's New Sudbury location.&nbsp; Recently though, they opened their Downtown location.&nbsp; Below, are their relative
  one-way distances from where I live:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Downtown
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Transit:</span>&nbsp; 5 Minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Walking:</span>&nbsp; 14 Minutes&nbsp; <sup>1.2 Kilometers</sup>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      New Sudbury
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Transit:</span>&nbsp; 33 Minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Walking:</span>&nbsp; 1 Hour, 15 Minutes&nbsp; <sup>6.1 Kilometers</sup>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Their new Downtown location is ~5km closer to my home than their New Sudbury location.&nbsp; I thought that this would mean easier access to their care for
  myself&hellip;&nbsp; Fuck, was I ever wrong, in thinking that having a closer location would make my life somewhat easier.
</p>
<img alt="" height="362" src="{{ site.uri.assets }}/blog/2017/06/03/im-not-a-fucking-addict/im-not-an-addict_482x362.png"
  style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" />
<p>
  I've attended their Downtown location on several occassions, and it's been a fucking nightmare, with each visit.&nbsp; In fact, I'd go so far as to say, each
  subsequent visit has been exponentially worse than the one before it.&nbsp; As can be seen on my <a
    href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-in-case-of-emergency-james-wd-stewart" rel="me" title="In Case of Emergency :: James W.D. Stewart">MedicAlert wallet
  card</a>, I'm on several long-term medications.&nbsp; While I'd never experienced a single issue at their New Sudbury location with getting my medications
  refilled, I've had drastically different experiences at their Downtown location.&nbsp; Moreover, I'm made to feel as a worthless drug addict by the doctors at
  their Downtown location.
</p>
<p>
  Not only have I had to arigue and fight with their Downtown doctors for something as benign as my anti-inflammatory (i.e. Arthrotec), but I've had even worse
  experiences in trying to get my pain medication refilled.&nbsp; One of their most ignorant fucktard doctors, on my most recent visit for a refill of my pain
  medication, simply told me to &quot;get a family doctor&quot; and proceeded to walk out of the examination room.&nbsp; Like, WTF?!?&nbsp; If getting a family
  doctor is so fucking simple, give me their contact information, and I'll gladly retain their services.&nbsp; But, of course, he couldn't tell me of a single
  doctor within Sudbury who was taking on new patients; especially, not patients with the complex needs that I'd require to manage my health care properly.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, I'm left with no option, other than to start going back to their New Sudbury location &#8212; 5 times farther, from my home, than their
  Downtown location.&nbsp; As per their Web site:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-northwood-medical-clinics">
    We prefer you go to the same location where you received care, however, if need be, we can always retrieve information from the other clinic.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  What a load of fucking shit &#8212; I've been getting my prescriptions from their New Sudbury location for some years now.&nbsp; I'm due to pick-up my new set
  of blister packs tomorrow.&nbsp; However, I'm still needing a refill of my pain medication to get them filled.&nbsp; The doctor that I saw today, at their
  Downtown location which is actually attached to the pharmacy which I use, told the pharmacist that he'd not refill my prescription and to go back to New
  Sudbury.&nbsp; He gave the pharmacist the hours that I should go to their New Sudbury location to see a specific doctor who'd refill my prescription.&nbsp;
  What &#8212; the &#8212; fuck?!?&nbsp; I have abso-fucking-lutely no history of abuse, double-flling, &quot;losing&quot;, selling, etc.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't required to get my medications filled in blister packs (i.e. compliance packaging), I'd requested it of my own volition.&nbsp; I'd aksed for the
  blister packs &#8212; otherwise, known as &quot;compliance packaging&quot; &#8212; in order to make my life easier.&nbsp; Given that I take several
  medications several times per day, being able to simply pop open a blister without needing to carry all of my pill bottles and shit, would be easier.&nbsp;
  Also, it makes it easier for me to not miss a dose of something and/or WTFever else.&nbsp; Frankly, it simplified my the process of taking my medications,
  throughout the day, for me.&nbsp; Between the NMS (i.e. Narcotics Monitoring System) and the blister packs (i.e. compliance packaging), it's relatively easy
  to see that I'm not abusing shit.
</p>
<p>
  I'm finding myself, like so many others, falling through the cracks.&nbsp; The fact that I don't have a family doctor doesn't somehow, miraculously, cure my
  ailments nor take away my pain.&nbsp; The way that this is going, I'll be forced to turn to drug dealers and illicit drugs for self-treatment in order to get
  the needed pain relief.&nbsp; I walk with a cane, and wear a full-orthosis &#8212 custom designed and manufactured by Sudbury Prosthetic, worth $3,000 &#8212;
  on my left leg, which helps to minimize the pain somewhat.&nbsp; However, neither alleviates it though.
