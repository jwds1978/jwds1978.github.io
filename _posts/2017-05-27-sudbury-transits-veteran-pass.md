<p>
  I had the misfortune of having to deal with a rather ignorant Sudbury Transit bus driver (whom I'll refer to as Damian Dolan) on 25 May 2017.&nbsp; I've since
  submitted a complaint against Damian, via e-mail, to Transit &#8212; CC to 311 and the mayor.&nbsp; I'd received an automated response from 311, indicating
  that I should receive a response within 2 business days&hellip;&nbsp; So, by the end of Monday.&nbsp; I've yet to receive any sort of acknowledgement and/or
  response from either Transit or the mayor though.
</p>
<p>
  While that incident with Damian is what led me to the subject of this posting, I'll not be saying much more about it within the context of this post.&nbsp;
  I'm giving the city an opportunity to resolve the issue(s) prior to writing a follow-up post wherein I'll go into detail about everything that's happened.
</p>
<p>
  With that said, was anybody aware of the fact that Sudbury Transit has a &quot;Canadian Veteran&quot; pass program in effect?&nbsp; I, as sure as Hell,
  wasn't.&nbsp; Having been in this city for several years now, and having constantly argued/fought with my worker for transportation funding, I've only just
  recently &#8212; within the last few days &#8212; been made aware of its existence.

  Pictured above, is my newly obtained Canadian Veteran transit pass.&nbsp; From what I've come to understand, they've had the program in-place for a number of
  years now.&nbsp; However, not a single local veteran that I've spoken with was aware of its existence though.
</p>
<p>
  If you're a Forces veteran, and ride the transit regularly, I'd encourage you to see about getting yourself one.&nbsp; Bear in mind though, you'll need to
  provide them with an acceptable <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-id-cheat-sheet-canadian-forces-appreciation-program" rel="me"
    title="ID Cheat Sheet :: Canadian Forces Appreciation Program">proof of your service</a> in order to qualify for it.&nbsp; Proof of service is required,
  you can't just walk-in as a stolen valour PoS, and claim false service to obtain it.
</p>
<p>
  If it weren't for the security guard (whom I'll refer to as Karl Braun), and the woman (whom I'll refer to as Kathleen Matthews) at the transt kiosk inside of
  the terminal, I'd more than likely not have ever known about it myself.&nbsp; I can't thank them enough &#8212; this will help me greatly, being on a
  fixed-income and all.&nbsp; Additionally, now that I do know about it, I've made it my mission to inform any local brothers/sisters that I happen to come in
  contact with of its existence.&nbsp; Thus far, not a single one that I've spoken with, had ever heard of it either.
