Friday, the 31<sup>st</sup>, I'm upgrading my laptop with the following:

* <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/B01K1JUO14" rel="me" title="">Kensington Microsaver 2.0 Keyed Cable Lock for Laptops and Other Devices (K65035AM)</a>
* <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/B00TZR3WRM" rel="me" title="">Logitech MX Master Wireless Mouse (910-004337)</a>
* <a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/mz-75e1t0b-am/10366522.aspx" target="_blank" title="">Samsung 850 EVO 1TB Internal Solid State Drive (MZ-75E1T0B/AM)</a>
* <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/B01ERYGUG2" rel="me" title="">Windows 10 Professional product key</a>

The SSD alone will be a significant upgrade.&nbsp; I was considering <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/B01G844OOO" rel="me" title="">the 4TB variant</a> of the
SSD, but opted for the 1TB drive for the moment.&nbsp; I really don't have the money to spend on a 4TB drive at the moment, but will upgrade to it (or larger if
available at the time) in the near future though.

As I'm going back to work, hence the upgrades, I'll look at further upgrades once I've completed a few
contracts.&nbsp; Presently, I have an ASUS VivoBook X541U, but am looking to upgrade to a <a href="{{ site.uri.aStore }}/#detail/B01N4JZ295" rel="me" title="">MSI
2017 Newest GT83VR 7RF-200CA Titan SLI. VR-Ready, i7-7920HQ GTX1080 SLI, 64GB/1TBSSD Plus 1TB Notebook Computer, Aluminum Black	MSI 2017 Newest GT83VR 7RF-200CA
Titan SLI. VR-Ready, i7-7920HQ GTX1080 SLI, 64GB/1TBSSD Plus 1TB Notebook Computer, Aluminum Black</a> though.&nbsp; Given its price-point, I'll clearly have to get
several contracts in before even considering such an upgrade.

After this weekend, I'll be starting to accept contracts.&nbsp; I've been generating some revenue from on-site ads, but I've made no real effort to promote it
though.&nbsp; However, even with the lack of promotion, there appears to be a noticeable amount of organic traffic anyhow.&nbsp; Going forward, I'll be creating
tutorials and such as well as having guest writers contributing content to the Web site now-and-again.
