    title="removeAdblock.com - Why using Adblockers is a bad idea!">RemoveAdblock.com</a> is a campaign started by Web sites which rely upon Internet ads to pay
  their bills.&nbsp; Creating content, maintenance, research, and server costs are all things that cost a lot of money.&nbsp; Without ad revenue, Web sites
  would have to find other ways of paying for stuff.&nbsp; This can lead to Web sites having to use more intrusive ads and/or charging money from their
  users.&nbsp; We all have our favourite Web sites, and should you happen to like a Web site that's driven by ad revenue, you're undermining their work by
  having Adblock turned on within your Web browser.

<p>
  While I dislike annoying adverts myslef, my primary source of revenue comes from ads.&nbsp; I can't nor will I, encourage anybody to randomly click upon an
  ad, either in support of me or for any other reason.&nbsp; With that said, I do need to eat and I do have bills to pay.&nbsp; There are re-curring costs
  associated with the maintenance and operation of this very Web site.
</p>
<p>
  As such, as you may have already noticed, I've recently started making an overt effort to block visitors with ad-blockers from viewing the content contained
  herein.&nbsp; While you need not completely uninstall your ad-blocker of choice, you'll need to at least white-list my domain(s).&nbsp; Otherwise, you won't
  be able to properly view my Web site&hellip;&nbsp; Exception being, I do provide a full Atom/RSS feed.&nbsp; I have no current desires to monetize said
  feed.&nbsp; This feed includes the full &#8212; not partial &#8212; content of posts to <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog" rel="me" title="">the blog</a>.

  The snowflakes of today want everything in life to be free, just like it was at home with daddy and/or mommy.&nbsp; At the end of the day, this is yet another
  &quot;entitlement&quot; problem.&nbsp; Free birth control&hellip;&nbsp; Free education&hellip;&nbsp; Free food&hellip;&nbsp; Free healthcare&hellip;&nbsp;
  Free housing&hellip;&nbsp; Free Web content&hellip;&nbsp; Free &#8212; all the things.
</p>
<p>
  When you buy &#8212; and read &#8212; a paper newspaper, you have every right to ignore the ads/flyers/inserts/etc. contained within it.&nbsp; You could even
  take the time, before reading the newspaper, to actually cut out all of the ads so that they aren't physically there when you sit down to read the content of
  the paper itself.&nbsp; However, you'd likely need to buy multiple copies of the paper in order to actually accomplish that, without also removing large
  chunks of the content you want to read.
</p>
<p>
  Having done all the abovementioned, at no time, did you ever stop the delivery of the ads.&nbsp; Rather, you simply made a point to ignore them and/or remove
  them after they'd been delivered to you.&nbsp; Similarly, you can also buy the paper and ignore all of the contents except for the racing form and/or
  classifieds and/or opinion section and/or the Sunday funnies&hellip;&nbsp; That's absolutely your call.&nbsp; But, at no time, did you stop the presses nor
  remove anything before it had been delivered to you.
</p>
<p>
  You also have every right to boycott the paper and/or to never buy it again.&nbsp; You may even go into competition with the paper, delivering a better
  product without ads.&nbsp; However, I'd doubt that you'd be able to get people to pay for an unsubsidized subscription.&nbsp; The high-cost of production, and
  increasing subscription prices, are amongst the reasons that the print newspaper industry's trying to evolve.
</p>
<p>
  You have every right to decide how your Web browser renders content &#8212; it's your browser, after all.&nbsp; And, should you decide to use an ad blocker, I
  don't really see much of a difference between that and skipping over the television ads within <abbr title="Digital Video Recorder">DVR</abbr> content.&nbsp;
  By the same token, publishers have that same right to tell you that if you want access to their content, you must accept their terms of service.&nbsp; If you
  don't like their terms, or whatever else, simply move along to another Web site&nbsp; As with any other business you may not like for whatever reason.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Admittedly, in the past, I've blocked ads myself.&nbsp; Quite simply, there were too many flashing up on my screen, every time that I wanted to look at
  anything &#8212; telling me to join some weight-loss scam, play poker, etc.&nbsp; So, I'd installed the browser extension that conveniently removes all ads
  from any Web page.&nbsp; But, I shouldn't have though.&nbsp; In doing so, I put the future of the free Internet under threat.
</p>
<p>
  If we all start using an ad-blocker, we're endangering the Internet as we know it.&nbsp; Our being able to get most anything on the Internet, without
  subscription fees to a Web site(s), relies almost entirely on ad revenue.&nbsp; Ad-blockers want to get rid of that revenue stream.&nbsp; By preventing people
  from seeing the ads, it's forcing companies to adopt different &#8212; and, most certainly &#8212; worse models.
</p>
<p>
  Think about it&hellip;&nbsp; An Internet ruled by ad-blockers would be one where ads would need to be so indistinguishable from genuine content, that
  ad-blocking technology couldn't distinguish the difference.&nbsp; The problem, for ads to be so subtle, they'd no longer be distinguishable by humans
  either.&nbsp; And, if this were to happen, nobody would read anything on a Web site they know that anybody can pay to write articles/content/stories in.
