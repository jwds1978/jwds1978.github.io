<p>
  While we don't talk about this all that often, there's a real fear within many of us that says if we heal, we'll lose our identities as warfighters.&nbsp;
  Fear that healing will cut the ties you have to who you were, who you are, and who you want to be.&nbsp; Along with it, is a fear that if you move on, it'll
  somehow mean that you're forgetting and/or leaving your fallen buddies behind &#8212; that becoming whole now, will invalidate the sacrifice and suffering
  that happened.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Let's have a look at this fear &#8212; as irrational as it may be.&nbsp; It's, closely, tied to the experience of having been at your ultimate best in combat
  and the deflated experience of life after &#8212; when you no longer really know and/or feel comfortable, with who you are, as a warfighter in civilian
  clothing.&nbsp; Many of us were retired and/or our military careers cut-short &#8212; which means that we didn't want to end-up in this civilian life which we
  now find orselves with.&nbsp; Some of you chose to get out, but still haven't found anything that can come close to your sense of being a warfighter though.
</p>
<p>
  The pain and grief that we carry inside of us is a tangible tie to an identity that we still feel, we miss, and we never want to lose &#8212; good news, we
  don't have to.&nbsp; It's also true though, that not all of you carry a warfighter identity.&nbsp; Some of you are more than happy to return to civilian life
  &#8212; and yet, you also struggle to fit-in.&nbsp; But, for those of you who know in your heart that you'll always be a warfighter, and that you'll never be
  better at anything than you were at hunting humans, this fear's enough to stop you cold in your tracks &#8212; especially, when it comes to healing.
</p>
<p>
  You're not wrong in being afraid&hellip;&nbsp; Anything, which threatens your identity and sense of self, will become something that you avoid.&nbsp; Even,
  when that something's moving into a place of less pain and more joy.&nbsp; This is why we feel torn.&nbsp; We've been led to believe that to heal, we must let
  go of our pain &#8212; of everything that we're carrying &#8212; and, for us, that means letting go of a part of ourselves, that keeps us being us.&nbsp; Fuck
  that shit, eh?
</p>
<p>
  Allow me to show you how this looks.&nbsp; You're tired of struggling, tired of the weight on your heart getting heavier, tired of being restless, tired of
  not knowing how to be who you're &quot;supposed&quot; to be now, tired of trying to appear fine, tired of being &#8212; you're, simply, fucking tired.&nbsp;
  So, you reach for healing &#8212; you found this Web site.&nbsp; You've tried all of the stuff that the VAC and/or your doctor's told you to do.&nbsp; You,
  always, end-up where you started.&nbsp; Things get a little better at times &#8212; then, worsen.&nbsp; Yet, you keep trying and keep looking.&nbsp; Something
  within you, desperately, wants relief.
</p>
<p>
  Then you get a glimpse of relief&hellip;&nbsp; And, when it appears as a real possibility &#8212; no matter how far-off on the horizon &#8212; terror seizes
  you and you can't move.&nbsp; You sense that you're losing yourself, shut-down, and pull-back.&nbsp; Who'll you be if you're not in pain, not carrying this
  weight, not wounded?&nbsp; Who'll you be, if healing means that you have to give up everything that you've got left, that keeps you feeling like a warfighter?
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, life seems safer within the darkness.&nbsp; You wonder what you were thinking when you thought, that perhaps, you could find some relief.&nbsp; This
  isn't what you'd hoped for.&nbsp; The pain's not so bad, eh?&nbsp; You've put-up with it this long &#8212; you can tolerate it, after all&hellip;&nbsp; It's
  comfortable.&nbsp; Sure, it fucking hurts most of the damn time, but it's your pain and you're used to it &#8212; it keeps you connected.&nbsp; It keeps you a
  warfighter.&nbsp; You fucking earned this damn pain.&nbsp; And, only you and your brothers/sisters understand that.&nbsp; There's no way in Hell that giving
  up your attachment to your pain could be good for you, eh?&nbsp; Actually, I don't believe that it is.
</p>
<p>
  So, you decide that if you're already this fucked-up, you might as well stay in a place where you at least know how to navigate it day-in and
  day-out&hellip;&nbsp; There's comfort in it.&nbsp; Perhaps, it's just who you're meant to be.&nbsp; Warfighters are nourished by the darkness and
  hate&hellip;&nbsp; If you're a warfighter, then you understand this.&nbsp; You feel more alive and connected, to the darkness and hate, than you'll ever feel
  to the light.&nbsp; You're not, even necessarily, sure if you believe in the light.&nbsp; You're not sure that you even want to look for the light.&nbsp; Part
  of you does, at times, but you thrive within the dark though&hellip;&nbsp; It's yours&hellip;&nbsp; It keeps you a warfighter.
</p>
<p>
  So, you feel torn &#8212; darkness, freedom, light, pain &#8212; carrying wounds of battle as a warrior.&nbsp; Healing and moving on as a, gulp,
  &quot;civilian&quot; &#8212; within your heart, you'll never be a civilian.&nbsp; You know that you should heal, you know that you should move into the light,
  part of you even longs to &#8212; but, not if it means leaving this brotherhood, of hate and rage, that keeps you belonging as a warfighter.&nbsp; You take
  steps forward, something &#8212; this &#8212; holds you back.&nbsp; So, you find a way to rationalize giving-up on ever feeling whole inside again.&nbsp; You
  decide to just stay as you fucking are.
</p>
<p>
  The question is, can you heal and still live within the dark?&nbsp; Can you heal and still embrace the hate?&nbsp; Can you remain a warfighter and not be in
  pain?&nbsp; Personally, I believe that we can.
</p>
<p>
  Healing's not about letting go &#8212; as much as everyone pushes that idea.&nbsp; It's not about having to open-up and share your wounds with others &#8212;
  athough, that can be very cathartic.&nbsp; Healing's all about what you think of, and the meaning that you give to, your pain.
</p>
<p>
  So, let's say that you decide to allow your wounds to heal.&nbsp; Yes, you must decide to &#8212; and, yes &#8212; you must allow it.&nbsp; What if, you could
  heal, and never have to let go of what happened?&nbsp; What if, by creating some new meaning around your experiences, you could think new thoughts that would
  bring you peace?
</p>
<p>
  So, you'd continue to carry the experiences, but not the hurt.&nbsp; You'd continue to honour the experiences, the fallen, and the sacrifice.&nbsp; While, at
  the same time, you'd become alright with feeling joy and/or beauty and/or a sense of being whole.&nbsp; Your pain's given new meaning and context, the hurt
  eases, and it remains part of the fabric of who you are.
</p>
<p>
  Too many healing &quot;therapies&quot; out there, are designed, to get you to expose and give-up your pain &#8212; to let go, to neatly strip you of being a
  warfighter.&nbsp; Let's face it, most civilians are scared shitless to walk into the darkest interior of a warrior's heart, where killing humans feels good
  &#8212; and, into being a good, tame, don't-scare-us civilian.&nbsp; You'll never be a civilian in your heart and there's no fucking reason why you should
  have to either.
</p>
<p>
  You get to decide who the fuck you are.&nbsp; You get to decide what your pain means to you.&nbsp; You get to decide that you can be a warfighter, can embrace
  the hate, can live within the darkness &#8212; and, at the same time, you can heal the wounds so that the pain's gone &#8212; and, only scars remain.&nbsp;
  You can take the energy of hate and funnel it, into something that serves a purpose, which means something to you.
</p>
<p>
  Civilians tend to do us warfighters a huge disservice when they start to define what healing looks like for us &#8212; instead, of allowing us to say what it
  would feel like to be whole, and plotting a path to get there.&nbsp; We do ourselves a disservice, when we allow the fear of losing ourselves, to keep us from
  becoming whole.
</p>
<p>
  What would wholeness feel like to you?&nbsp; What would your life look like, if you could openly embrace your warfighter identity, now?&nbsp; Where could
  and/or would you funnel that energy?&nbsp; How could and/or would you take the values which you embrace as a warrior, and apply them, to make an impact in the
  world?&nbsp; What would your heart feel like, if it didn't hurt so much, and it still carried the full sense of what happened?&nbsp; What can you do, today,
  to create your own definition of wholeness?
</p>
<p>
  You, must, decide&hellip;
