</p>
<p>
  In the above passage from <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-paradise-lost" rel="me" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a>, Satan's launched his
  unsuccessful war against God and heaven, and had rightfully been cast down into the pits of Hell.&nbsp; He finds himself chained in unbreakable chains, to
  the floor of a fiery pit, without even the comfort of light from the flames.&nbsp; In &quot;darkness visible&quot;, he sees only &quot;sights of woe, regions
  of sorrow, doleful shades&quot;.&nbsp; In the absence of God's presence, he flails about in pain, doomed to never know peace, rest, nor hope again.
</p>
<p>
  It was on a rather beautiful spring day &#8212; birds chirping, sun shining in through the window, adoring, four-legged friends at my feet &#8212; that I used
  the aforementioned passage, to describe to my girlfriend of the time, how empty and defeated depression made me feel.
</p>
<p>
  We have different names for such things now.&nbsp; However, &quot;sights of woe&quot; sounds an awful lot like intrusive thoughts.&nbsp; To me anyhow,
  &quot;doleful shades&quot; accurately described the synesthesia of strength-draining darkness that had creeped over me.&nbsp; With all promise of
  &quot;rest&quot; and &quot;peace&quot;, dashed by medical science, and the constant voices of doubt within my head &#8212; I'd, most certainly, lost hope.
</p>
<p>
  Worst of all though?&nbsp; The closest comparison that I could come up with, to describe myself, was that of Satan.&nbsp; A lot of doctors, would call that
  &quot;a poor self-image&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Fast-forward several years&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  Not many people talk about suicidal ideation.&nbsp; It seems that they're either embarrassed, worried about alarming their loved ones, and/or afraid of being
  locked-up.&nbsp; Of course, all of these reasons, are valid.&nbsp; However, I made a promise &#8212; some time ago, now &#8212; to be open and honest about
  what I'm going through.&nbsp; I think that it makes me stronger, while helping those around me.&nbsp; So, again, here it goes.
</p>
<p>
  The other night, I was lying on a makeshift bed of cardboard in a back alley &#8212; completely, in the dark &#8212; waiting to fall asleep.&nbsp; The
  self-effacing negativity, and spitting of curses at myself, ran rampant as it had for some time.&nbsp; It was something that I'd grown accustomed to.&nbsp;
  The dark thoughts are easier to push away when I'm alert.&nbsp; When I'm tired though, about to fall asleep, it's often a very different story.
</p>
<p>
  For me, as a man who had experienced a suicide in his immediate family, it will never be an option.&nbsp; I realize, on both an emotional and intellectual
  level, that it only hurts the ones whom you love.&nbsp; But, that doesn't stop the theatre of the macabre from acting itself out in my head anyway.&nbsp;
  Thoughts and images of hurting myself, flash before my eyes, faster than I can stop them.&nbsp; I know that I'll never act on them&hellip;&nbsp; I know that
  I'm, physically, in control.&nbsp; Still &#8212; and, I doubt that I'm alone on this &#8212; simply having the thoughts, can be discouraging.
</p>
<p>
  I find that flashes of self-harm occur rather vividly and alongside waves of self-deprecation and doubt.&nbsp; The slightest slip-up and/or failure can
  trigger them.&nbsp; Those who know me well, have learnt that I vent this negativity, through creativity and jokes.&nbsp; As with most all veterans, I've got a
  somewhat fucked-up &#8212; dark, twisted, and warped &#8212; sense of humour.
</p>
<p>
  I've been grappling with this issue, both intellectually and spiritually, for quite some time now.&nbsp; My goal has been to, symbolically, represent the
  causes of the condition through language and understand &#8212; beyond the limits of medical science &#8212; the role of my soul.&nbsp; But, learning causes,
  didn't result in the ability to produce effects.&nbsp; So, with each passing day, I'd learn something new.&nbsp; Each night, I'd lie in the dark &#8212;
  struggling &#8212; waiting, for that ability to come to me.
</p>
<p>
  Suicidal ideation's like being strapped to a chair and forced to watch a really graphic movie of your own death.&nbsp; Here's the catch&hellip;&nbsp; You're
  both, the protagonist and the antagonist &#8212; literally, your own worst enemy.&nbsp; The voice that you hear, the one screaming that you're
  &quot;disgusting&quot; and/or &quot;pathetic&quot; and/or &quot;weak&quot;, it's your own voice.&nbsp; And, after a while, you become convinced that you're
  the one doing the talking.&nbsp; Why wouldn't you?&nbsp; It's your voice&hellip;&nbsp; Your brain&hellip;&nbsp; You're the one, conjuring up these thoughts,
  because you're &quot;sick&quot; right?
</p>
<p>
  I'm no longer convinced.
</p>

<p>
  On the night in question, I looked over&hellip;&nbsp; There sat my trusty knife &#8212; the one, which PTSD tells me to keep ready for threats, at all
  times.&nbsp; Then, came a flash of me stabbing myself and collapsing on my makeshift bed.&nbsp; It lasted for less than a second&hellip;&nbsp; However, it was
  so disturbing and graphic, that it wounded me.&nbsp; It was like being punched in the gut.
</p>
<p>
  In its shocking repetition, suicidal ideation, makes you feel very much like a victim of abuse.&nbsp; But, you're the abuser.&nbsp; What the fuck gives,
  eh?&nbsp; I was in control, but the thoughts weren't going away though.&nbsp; I felt like I was losing the battle &#8212; that it would just get worse and
  worse, until I was no longer in control.&nbsp; That's what knocked the wind right out of me.
</p>
<p>
  I said to myself, &quot;You know, if you're thinking about offing yourself, the responsible thing to do would be to secure the weapon&quot;.
  <blockquote>
    Ya, I don't want to do that.&nbsp; What if somebody attacks me?
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  I tried to be rational.&nbsp; It dawned on me, that the safest alternative to securing the weapon, would be to crawl over to a corner of the alley and sleep
  there.&nbsp; Then, it hit me &#8212; I'd just told myself, to curl up in the fetal position, in a corner of the alley.
  <blockquote>
    How did it get to this point?&nbsp; Listen to yourself!
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  In the background, during all of this, that vile and contemptuous voice kept talking.&nbsp; It had been telling me to &quot;do it&quot; &#8212; reinforcing
  its previous points about my being disgusting, pathetic, and/or weak.&nbsp; In my mind's eye, I stepped back for a minute, and asked myself something which
  I'd not before:
  <blockquote>
    If I'm listening, who's doing the damn talking?
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  I created a representation of the scene, the best that I could, wihin my brain.&nbsp; I saw myself stepping away, outside of a circle of white light.&nbsp;
  Inside the circle, crouching and holding a severed head like a puppet, was the thing that had been talking.&nbsp; It was black like venom with skin the
  texture of a smoky-ink.&nbsp; The head that it was holding, and by extension the voice, was my own.&nbsp; But, I was obviously on the outside of the
  circle.&nbsp; I was listening.
</p>
<p>
  &quot;There you have it&quot;, it wasn't me talking after all.
</p>
<p>
  Some may describe what happened next as an epiphany, but it wasn't really that.&nbsp; It was more like something remembered &#8212; something, I used to know,
  but had forgotten.&nbsp; I paid, particular, attention to the voice.&nbsp; It tapered off&hellip;&nbsp; Its tone, described someone who'd just been
  caught&hellip;&nbsp; And, it muttered something to the effect of &quot;this doesn't change anything&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  But, I knew better.&nbsp; I made a conscious decision to listen, and for the first time in months, the voice shut its damned mouth.
</p>
<p>
  What ensued was astounding&hellip;&nbsp; My head and face tingled.&nbsp; I felt a, distinct, crunching feeling within the tip-top of my brain &#8212; as if,
  the folds of my cerebral cortex, were tightening and strengthening themselves.&nbsp; I'm used to getting headaches, but a new and different one presented
  itself at my forehead.&nbsp; I welcomed it&hellip;&nbsp; I knew something big was happening.&nbsp; That some new &#8212; or, old and forgotten &#8212; pathway
  was being opened-up and I was (re)learning how to make use of it.
</p>
<p>
  Within &quot;darkness visible&quot;, I'd opened my eyes.
</p>
<p>
  Since that time, I've come to call the voice, the &quot;Puppet Master&quot;.&nbsp; It was as though he'd had his hand inside of the back of my neck, making me
  spout-off terrible obscenities and lies about myself.&nbsp; The sound of my own voice did a lot to convince me.&nbsp; But, then again, so did the constant
  message that there was something wrong with me.
</p>
<p>
  There may be something wrong with my brain&hellip;&nbsp; There may be something wrong with the way in which I live my life and/or the decisions that I've
  made&hellip;&nbsp; There's, definitely, something wrong with the things that have happened to me.&nbsp; But, those things aren't and have never been me.&nbsp;
  I held, somewhere deep down inside, the view that there was something defective with my soul &#8212; that I deserved the constant torment.&nbsp; It was a lie,
  and now that I've learned to put a muzzle on the liar, it's one that makes me burn with a healthy anger &#8212; rooted in self-respect.
</p>
<p>
  I'm sure the Puppet Master reinforced that lie.&nbsp; He still likes to catch me unaware and slip in self-hate and violence when he gets the chance.&nbsp;
  But, I'm onto his game now though.&nbsp; When I catch him, I get angry.&nbsp; I step out of the circle, locate him, and drag his wretched ass to a nice box
  that I constructed in the corner of my mind.&nbsp; I borrowed the box metaphor from my fellow veterans.&nbsp; Now, I know what to put in there.
</p>
<p>
  What should you make of all of this?&nbsp; I don't really know.&nbsp; You may think that I've lost my mind and/or that I've used too many psychedelic
  drugs.&nbsp; To me, it seems like a lot of veterans &#8212; and, people struggling with mental illness, in general &#8212; believe lies about
  themselves.&nbsp; What I've done, in my best estimation, is find a way in which to represent the source of the lies &#8212; a Puppet Master &#8212; and, a way
  to control it.&nbsp; Some people achieve this through medication and therapy, others through exercise, and still others through religion and service.&nbsp; My
  journey has been a combination of all of these things and it's far from over.&nbsp; However, I've just won a major battle.
</p>
<p>
  For now, I'll just keep listening.&nbsp; I'd encourage you to take the time to listen to yourself too.&nbsp; You may be surprised at what you come to learn.
