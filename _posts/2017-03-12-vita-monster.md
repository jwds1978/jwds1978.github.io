The docor's going to complete another Assistive Devices Program (ADP) form for me in order to get a powered mobility scooter.&nbsp; The program will cover
100% of its cost, as they did for my orthotic.

I'm not sure as to what specific brands and/or models are approved and/or covered by the ADP, but this one would be nice to have though&hellip;

&nbsp;<br />
Given that I like to outdoor stuffs (i.e. camping, fishing, hunting, etc.), one such as that in the video above would be ideal for me.&nbsp; But, I'll need
to talk to an ADP vendor though and see what they have that's ADP-approved though.
