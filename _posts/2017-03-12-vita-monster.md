<p>
  The docor's going to complete another Assistive Devices Program (ADP) form for me in order to get a powered mobility scooter.&nbsp; The program will cover
  100% of its cost, as they did for my orthosis.

<p>
  I'm not sure as to what specific brands and/or models are approved and/or covered by the ADP, but this one would be nice to have though&hellip;

  &nbsp;<br />
  Given that I like to do outdoor stuffs (i.e. camping, fishing, hunting, etc.), one such as that in the video above would be ideal for me.&nbsp; But, I'll need
  to talk to an ADP vendor though and see what they have that's ADP-approved.
