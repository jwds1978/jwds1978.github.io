  People from all walks of life can face dealing with PTSD&hellip;&nbsp; Someone who's in a car crash, a policeman, someone who's assaulted, etc.&nbsp; People
  who struggle with PTSD all have similar problems and/or issues.&nbsp; However, Combat PTSD, is the outcome of many weeks, months, or years of experiencing
  life threatening.

  Below, is a poem about Combat PTSD.&nbsp; I've tried several different ways of verifying its origins, find out more about the writer, etc.&nbsp; However, the
  only information that I was able to find is that it's thought to have been written by a Vietnam veteran &#8212; who was also a member of the Nez Perce tribe
  &#8212; who went through the North Chicago VA Combat Trauma Program in 1991, and that since then, his writing's given out to all of the vets who want a copy.
  <blockquote>
    They said I would be changed in my body.&nbsp; I would move through the physical world in a different manner.&nbsp; I would have pain where there was no
    blood.&nbsp; I would react to sights, sounds, movement and touch in a crazy way, as though I were back in war.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They said I would be wounded in my thoughts.&nbsp; I would forget how to trust, and I would think that others were trying to hurt me.&nbsp; I would see
    dangers in the kindness and concern of my relatives and others.&nbsp; Most of all, I would not be able to think in a reasonable manner, and it would seem
    that everyone else was crazy.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They told me that it would appear to me that I was alone even in the midst of the people, and that there was no one else like me.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They warned me that it would be as though my emotions were locked up, and I would be cold in my heart and not remember the ways of caring for others.&nbsp;
    While I might give meat and blankets to the elders, or food to the children, I would not be able to feel the goodness of these actions.&nbsp; That I would
    do these things out of habit and not from caring.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They predicted that I might do harm to others without plan or intention.&nbsp; They knew that my spirit would be wounded.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    They said I would be lonely and that I would find no comfort in family, friends, elders or spirits.&nbsp; I would be cut off from both beauty and
    pain.&nbsp; My dreams would be dark and frightening.&nbsp; My days would be filled with searching and not finding.&nbsp; I would not be able to find
    connections between myself and the rest of creation.&nbsp; I would look forward to an early death.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    And, I would need cleansing in all these things.

  Regardless of its origins, this poem says a lot about the challenges and difficulties that we &#8212; as warriors &#8212; face.&nbsp; We must have, the
  support and understanding, as we struggle with &quot;the beast&quot; known as Combat PTSD.

  Combat-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder &#8212; Combat PTSD &#8212; isn't just something that happens to a soldier when they have to kill
  someone&hellip;&nbsp; Although, that can play a part.&nbsp; It's about what happens, physically and psychologically, inside of a soldier's brain when they're
  faced with weeks, months, or years of constant adrenaline, danger, death, and/or fear.&nbsp; This enormous and prolonged stress, quite literally, changes the
  way that our brain looks and functions.

<h3 id="physical-changes">
  Physical Changes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Adrenaline Response:</span>&nbsp; When we're in danger, our brain flips into &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, a place
    where it's primed to decide whether or not we should run or engage a threat.&nbsp; Our bodies make two handy hormones that cause this response &#8212;
    noradrenaline which handles fight, and adrenaline which is responsible for flight.&nbsp; In &quot;normal&quot; brains, these hormones are released by a
    current threat (i.e. when someone's standing face-to-face with a bear.&nbsp; But, in a brain affected with PTSD, these hormones are triggered not by actual
    threats, but by reminders of threats that occurred months or even years before.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Grey Matter:</span>&nbsp; The grey matter area of our brain's responsible for processing information from our body (i.e.
    sensory neurons) and sending information to our body (i.e. motor neurons).&nbsp; Veterans have 5&#8211;10% less grey matter after having developed
    PTSD.&nbsp; This means that their neurons &#8212; their communication signals &#8212; have been damaged.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Hippocampus:</span>&nbsp; The hippocampus is a section of our brain which plays an important part in short-term memory
    and the regulation of our emotions.&nbsp; Researchers, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, have been able to determine that the hippocampus of veterans
    with PTSD had actually suffered damage.&nbsp; They believe that this damage may be under stress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Prefrontal Cortex:</span>&nbsp; Our prefrontal cortex helps us to decide how we experience and/or react to an emotion
    and/or resolve conflicts.&nbsp; It also tells our brain once a threat's passed.&nbsp; People with PTSD have altered blood flow to this area of their brain
    &#8212; the more change in flow, the more severe the symptoms of PTSD tend to be.&nbsp; This decrease in function, causes their brain to sort of be stuck,
    in a permanent fear mode &#8212; it doesn't relay the &quot;all clear&quot; message.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="mental-and-or-psychological-changes">
  Mental and/or Psychological Changes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Aggression and/or Hostility:</span>&nbsp; Veterans with PTSD exhibit, significantly higher, levels of aggression and/or
    hostility than the general public or even than other soldiers who have experienced combat.&nbsp; Since they have lived for a long period of time where they
    needed to aggressively react at a moment's notice, in order to stay alive, this way of acting has become an ingrained habit within them.&nbsp; Spouses often
    joke that it's not safe to wake a sleeping veteran from anywhere close by.&nbsp; This is because, when startled awake, the vet can react with an
    unbelievably strong amount of aggression &#8212; he may believe that he's responding to an unknown threat.&nbsp; On a wider scale, it's quite common for
    individuals with PTSD to get into fights, drive aggressively, become angry at insignificant things, and/or drastically over-react to any sort of challenge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Depression and/or Suicide:</span>&nbsp; People with post-traumatic stress disorder are seven times more likely to be
    depressed than someone else within the general population.&nbsp; It's one of the largest complaints associated with PTSD.&nbsp; And, unfortunately, this
    depression goes hand-in-hand with high rates of suicide amongst our nation's returning heroes.&nbsp; It's estimated that 22 commit suicide each day.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Guilt:</span>&nbsp; The guilt associated with post-traumatic stress disorder is often called
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-the-moral-logic-of-survivor-guilt" rel="me" title="The Moral Logic of Survivor Guilt">survivor's guilt</a>.&nbsp;
    The veteran feels a great deal of guilt because he survived an attack when a comrade didn't.&nbsp; He feels guilty, that a friend lost their legs in an
    explosion, while he remained relatively untouched.&nbsp; He feels guilty that he's at home, in safe surroundings, while others that he fought alongside are
    still in harm's way.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Lack of Trust:</span>&nbsp; This change, in a veteran with PTSD, is also caused by his time in combat.&nbsp; While in
    combat, he had to assume that everyone he met &#8212; even those who were called allies &#8212; were possible enemies.&nbsp; The only people that he knew he
    could rely on, in order to stay alive, were himself and those within his immediate group &#8212; people who'd proven themselves to each other in
    combat.&nbsp; After that same veteran returns home, he feels alone, and without the protection of his battle-tested counterparts.&nbsp; He doesn't trust
    anybody else &#8212; not even people that he's known for his entire life &#8212; to be able to watch-out for him.&nbsp; He feels that he, alone, is the only
    one whom he can count on and/or trust.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Paranoia:</span>&nbsp; In war, a paranoid soldier's a soldier who stays alive.&nbsp; Every item in his environment, from
    a pothole to a child carrying a backpack, must be regarded as a potential threat.&nbsp; When that same soldier, whose mind has been changed by PTSD returns
    home, he's often unable to shut-off his vigilant behaviour.&nbsp; Veterans will often and almost constantly, &quot;patrol&quot; their homes to check for
    intruders, insist that they sit with their backs to a wall and facing the door so that they can analyze every person who enters a room, and/or even drive
    off the road in order to avoid discarded trash &#8212; because this, often, indicates an Improvised Explosive Device during combat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Poor Coping Skills:</span>&nbsp; Due to the physical and mental changes that a veteran with PTSD has, they're often
    unable to cope in what most people would consider &quot;normal&quot; circumstances.&nbsp; They're easily overwhelmed by too much noise, too many people, too
    many changes, and/or too much stimuli of any sort.&nbsp; Dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, and all of its symptoms, takes most of their energy
    and concentration.&nbsp; Anything else, especially something that's unexpected, can cause a violent reaction and/or simply cause the veteran to shut-down.
  </li>
</ul>

  &nbsp;<br />
  Understanding these changes helps many people understand, for the first time, just how &quot;real&quot; post-traumatic stress disorder is.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, hidden wounds, such as PTSD), are often hard for people to grasp and/or empathize with.&nbsp; Hopefully, after learning more about the
  &quot;mechanics&quot; behind PTSD, you'll be better able to talk about PTSD and the real impact that it can have on the life of a veteran and/or those who
  love and/or care for him/her.
