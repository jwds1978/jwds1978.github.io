<p>
  As you may or may not have noticed, I've started adding various ad units throughout the Web site.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  While I'd considered AdSense, I've opted for <a href="https://a-ads.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anonymous Ads">Anonymous Ads</a>
  instead.&nbsp; I like their network model, in as much as, it's extremely easy to get setup and they payout in Bitcoin.&nbsp; Google doesn't support Bitcoin
  payments&hellip;&nbsp; Something which is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
  While I can't explicitly tell you to click on the ad(s), nor would I ever do so, I would suggest that you feel free to click on any ad(s) which happen to
  tickle your fancy.&nbsp; Should you be looking for an ad network and/or revenue source for your own Web site(s), and/or be wanting to advertise your own
  thing(s), be sure to checkout <a href="https://a-ads.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anonymous Ads">Anonymous Ads</a> for yourself.
