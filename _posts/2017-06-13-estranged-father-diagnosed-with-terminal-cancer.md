<p>
  Let me start this with a little back-story&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  I've been estranged &#8212; or, rather, alienated &#8212; from my family for the vast majority of my life.&nbsp; My entire life, for as long as I can
  remember, both parents have &#8212; significantly &#8212; favoured my sister over me.&nbsp; Between &frac23; and &frac34; of mothers have a favourite child
  &#8212; in my family it's, without doubt, my sister.&nbsp; I grew up in a somewhat abusive household.&nbsp; Primarily, my father being abusive with my
  mother.&nbsp; Moreover, my life had taken an unwarranted &#8212; and, wrongful &#8212; turn for the worse, as a direct result of my sister's actions.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  For me, my family relations have been rather toxic; at best.&nbsp; The dynamics of my family metastasized into a toxic resentment.&nbsp; Over the years, I've
  made several overt efforts to rebuild some sort of a relationship with my family.&nbsp; However, nothing ever really changed&hellip;&nbsp; At least, not for
  the better anyhow.&nbsp; Hell, I'd gone as far as moving back to the same city as my parents.&nbsp; And, while they didn't hesitate to spend 20+ hours a day
  at my sister's, they couldn't even be bother to call me &#8212; let alone, actually come to visit me.
</p>
<p>
  I'd listen to my parents when they told me that they wanted to reconcile with me, that they were sorry, etc.&nbsp; But, their behaviour towards me never
  changed though.&nbsp; Each time, I set myself up to get further hurt by them.&nbsp; While I'd given my sister an open-invitation to contact me whenever she
  saw fit, it never happened.&nbsp; My mom once told me, that she'd told her it was because she was afraid of getting close to me, for me to move away
  again.&nbsp; Although I can't speak to whether or not my sister had actually told my mom such thing, if she had, quite frankly, I'd say it's a load of fucking
  shit.&nbsp; I'd think that, more than likely, my sister feels guilty for &#8212; undeservingly &#8212; destroying my life, as she had, all those years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, I came to a point in my life, where I decided to simply sever all ties with my so-called &quot;family&quot;.&nbsp; I know what I know, have facts
  to go on, and made my decision.&nbsp; I've never looked back.&nbsp; Admittedly, it wasn't the easiest of choices, but I've always felt confident about it
  nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, people have often asked me if I'd ever considered trying to rebuild my relationship with my family.&nbsp; Neighbours, parents of my friends,
  my in-laws, and even my wife (when I was married) have at one point asked me this very personal and rather insulting question.&nbsp; Insulting, because by
  their asking, would seem as though they thought that I'd made the wrong decision&hellip;&nbsp; I know that I didn't.
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, I've not considered forming even the tiniest of connections with my family.&nbsp; I've not felt as though I was missing out on
  anything.&nbsp; Hell, I'd even go as far as saying that they're not people whom I give a damn about.&nbsp; Moreover, it wasn't until 08 May 2017, when a
  former friend contacted me via Facebook, that I'd given any thought to them.&nbsp; His message to me was:
  <blockquote>
    Hey just got a message for you<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Hi Oscar,<br />
    If you are still in contact with Jamie please have him call home.&nbsp; Karl is not well and time is of the essence.&nbsp; Our phone number is
    &times;&times;&times;-&times;&times;&times;-&times;&times;&times;&times;.&nbsp; Thanks
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Although my sister had also sent me a message via Facebook Messenger on 10 May 2017, I didn't readily notice it, as it had been filtered to the &quot;Message
  Requests&quot; part of Facebook.&nbsp; At the time, I didn't have the Facebook app istalled on my mobile device.&nbsp; So, I wasn't aware of her message until
  just a few days ago.&nbsp; Her message to me:
  <blockquote>
    Hey Dad has terminal cancer.&nbsp; He wants to talk to you.&nbsp; Their number hasnt changed.&nbsp; Please call him
  </blockquote>

<p>
  Until the last few weeks, I didn't dwell on the things that my family had chosen to do in their lives.&nbsp; After all, we were estranged, and lived on
  separate planets.&nbsp; Recently, I've thought about and picked apart all of the horrible things that my family has done as people, as members of society
  &#8212; but, most importantly &#8212; as family, with renewed eyes.&nbsp; Their negative actions have taught me so much, about how not to be as a human, that
  it fuels me to be as good of a person as I can be.
</p>
<p>
  For this, I'm thankful.&nbsp; By no means am I perfect, and I may not always get it right, but I get up every morning and I do the best that I can with a
  moral compass.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Realistically, I don't foresee anything good coming from dashing-off for a &quot;death-bed reconciliation&quot;.&nbsp; Life's hard &#8212; all around.&nbsp;
  I've got my own immediate problems and shit to deal with and/or work-out.&nbsp; Things don't always work-out the way that we'd like&hellip;&nbsp; So, be
  it.&nbsp; With that said, I've got some mixed emotions.&nbsp; I suppose that I should feel something &#8212; expectations dictate that I should.&nbsp;
  Perhaps, I should go see him before he dies.&nbsp; Why though?&nbsp; It hadn't mattered before.
</p>
<p>
  In all honesty, it's fucking annoying.&nbsp; My life interrupted, for this announcement, just enough to stir-up long since buried and made-peace-with
  issues.&nbsp; Just enough, to remind me of my family loss.&nbsp; Just enough, to raise questions within my heart again.&nbsp; Just enough, to remind me of
  what I'd not had.&nbsp; Just enough, to piss me right-the-fuck off that I &#8212; for the most part &#8212; never really had a family.&nbsp; Just enough, to
  remind me how envious that I am of those whom had family and really mourned their passing.
</p>
<p>
  He's sick.&nbsp; I'm sorry to hear it.&nbsp; Hopefully, he feels better soon &#8212; I don't, particularly, wish him any ill-will.&nbsp; But, that stranger
  walking down the street &#8212; they're sick too &#8212; and, I wish them equally well.&nbsp; They could have been in my life, but in their actions, they'd
  chosen not to be.&nbsp; I wish that I could put into words how I truly feel, but the words escape me though.
</p>
<p>
  By this point, I don't even know one way or the other&hellip;&nbsp; He may be alive, he may be dead&hellip;&nbsp; He may be in remission, he may have already
  been buried or WTFever.&nbsp; My parents have both been blocked on Facebook, for quite some time now, and I'd proceeded to block my sister upon reading her
  message.
