<p>
  No war's a good war.&nbsp; At times, we've acted no better than our worst enemy &#8212; we're not blameless.&nbsp; We denied the Holocaust &#8212; for
  instance &#8212; choosing, instead, to disbelieve the evidence.&nbsp; Again, we denied the genocide in Rwanda, choosing not to believe what was
  happening.&nbsp; And still, we close our eyes and ears, to the ongoing atrocities and slaughter in Africaâ€“Darfur, the Congo, and elsewhere around the world.
</p>
<p>
  What's worse, war hasn't stopped the struggle for wealth and control.&nbsp; Secret wars still go on, behind political posturing &#8212; each world power,
  seeking intelligence that it can use against the other &#8212; manipulating events, and in the end, creating more terror and worse horrors for the innocent
  who never know why they've been sacrificed, or for what cause.&nbsp; And now, with an economic depression compressing the world, more and more suffering's
  brought to bear on everyone &#8212; everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  And, then there are the lives of the men and women we sacrifice in our military forces, in the interest of preserving our freedom(s) at home.&nbsp; They
  believe in their missions and their fellow soldiers.&nbsp; It's difficult not to, when your boots are on the ground, and you with your buddy beside you, can
  see that you're the only ones making a difference in someone else's life.&nbsp; That's the hook that keeps aid volunteers and military forces continually in
  harm's way&hellip;&nbsp; They see how much their care matters.
</p>
<p>
  Whether we're aware of it or not, we're all victims of war &#8212; whether abroad or here, whether economical or political &#8212; while greed races, to
  accumulate more power.&nbsp; Right now, dreams of peace and hope grow ever-dimmer for a great portion of humanity, as we circle our wagons to protect our
  own.&nbsp; Instead of reaching out, we turn in&hellip;&nbsp; It's the nature of survival.
