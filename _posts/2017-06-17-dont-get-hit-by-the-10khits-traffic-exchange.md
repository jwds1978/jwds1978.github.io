  Given that you're here, reading this post, you're already familiar with one of the harsh realities of marketing online &#8212; or, anywhere
  really&hellip;&nbsp; Without Web traffic, you don't stand much of a chance at making money.
</p>
<p>
  It doesn't matter how great the quality of the solution that you have is, you won't make any money if you don't generate traffic &#8212; period.&nbsp; How do

</p>
<p>
  Some people have ideas, products, and/or solutions that they'd like to recommend.&nbsp; However, they don't have the audience to recommend these things to
  though. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-10khits-traffic-exchange-free-website-traffic-to-your-site" rel="me"

<h3 id="hows-it-work">
  How's it Work?
</h3>
<p>
  Let's break this down &#8212; Barney-style&hellip;&nbsp; It's a networking Web site, wherein members click and view ads, and receive other people's clicks and
  views in-return.&nbsp; Essentially, you aren't going to be getting any real Web traffic that could convert.&nbsp; All that you're getting, are other members
  from the platform, clicking on your Web site &#8212; because, they have to do so.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing that you'll need to do after creating your account, and filling out your profile, is to download their exchanger software.
  <blockquote cite="https://www.10khits.com/#features">
    The exchanger lets you continuously surf and earn points without any interruptions, pop ups or frame breakers.&nbsp; The exchanger is a well-rounded
    application with a nimble dashboard that will get you earning your first points and receiving visitors to your website instantly!
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Basically, you earn traffic points for every &times;-second visit.&nbsp; These traffic points allow for you to create your own ad campaigns &#8212; leading
  people back to your own Web site.&nbsp; That's, primarily, the essence of it.

  Their Claimed Benefits
</h3>
<p>
  The so-called benefits of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-10khits-traffic-exchange-free-website-traffic-to-your-site" rel="me"
    title="10KHits Traffic Exchange: Free Website Traffic to Your Site">10KHits</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Boost Your Alexa Rank:</span>&nbsp; I've, yet to understand, people's obsession with Alexa rankings.&nbsp; Their claim
      that &quot;Alexa rank is a site's traffic rank compared to all other sites on the Web&quot; is unequivocally flawed &#8212; wrong, even!&nbsp; Alexa
      rankings are calculated based upon the number of people that have the Alexa toolbar installed &#8212; and, active &#8212; within their Web browser.&nbsp;
      Granted, more visitors will improve your Alexa rank&hellip;&nbsp; But, how does an improved Alexa rank without sales, help you and/or your business?
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Increase Web Site Value:</span>&nbsp; As somebody who's sold a few Web sites over the years, I can say, this type of
      low-quality traffic won't increase the value of your Web site in any way&hellip;&nbsp; Especially, when the Web site's not making any money.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Lower Bounce Rate:</span>&nbsp; Most definitely, this will largely increase your bounce rate &#8212; not lower decrease
      it.&nbsp; The people viewing your Web site don't care about it.&nbsp; They just want to be there for &times; seconds, get their points, and be on their
      way.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">No Footprints:</span>&nbsp; This seems rather black-hat to me.&nbsp; Regardless, I'll not say too much regarding
      it.&nbsp; While you can hide your traffic sources should you want to, isn't the whole point of wanting traffic, to make money off of whatever you're
      offering.&nbsp; How does disguising and/or otherwise masking your Web traffic sources help you to achieve that?
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Real Human Visitors:</span>&nbsp; Yes, these are real human beings that'll be visiting your Web site.&nbsp; However,
      are you looking for human beings that click on your Web site solely because they have to, or human beings that actually want to interact with your Web
      site?&nbsp; How does someone whom only clicks on your Web site to earn &quot;traffic points&quot; help to make you money?
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Sky-Rocket Web Stats:</span>&nbsp; If you set your own ad campaigns for 20&#8211;60 seconds, people will only stay
      there for that long &#8212; they have to.&nbsp; Their staying for that long doesn't really increase your chances of making a sale.&nbsp; Let's be
      honest&hellip;&nbsp; Do you really think that they're actually reading and/or taking-in the content of your Web site?
    </li>
  </ul>
  The stark truth, is that these members are as much marketers as you.&nbsp; All of you are wanting the same thing&hellip;&nbsp; You want traffic points &#8212;
  they want traffic points.&nbsp; That's why all of this clicking is even going on.

  The Pro
</h3>
<p>
  On the surface, having traffic should be a good thing&hellip;&nbsp; If what you want, is simply for people to just visit your Web site &#8212; and, you don't
  care if they're low-quality and/or non-targeted traffic &#8212; <a

    title="10KHits Traffic Exchange: Free Website Traffic to Your Site">10KHits</a>, thinking that you're getting real traffic to your Web site.&nbsp; In
  actuality, all that you're getting, are some of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-10khits-traffic-exchange-free-website-traffic-to-your-site"
    rel="me" title="10KHits Traffic Exchange: Free Website Traffic to Your Site">10KHits</a> members clicking on the ads which you'd posted to their network.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from the poor quality of the Web traffic, there's the challenge of getting people to even click your ad in the first place.&nbsp; There's nothing which
  you can do in order to make your ad stand-out from the rest of the pack.&nbsp; So, what if people don't click on yours?

    rel="me" title="Content quality guidelines | Yahoo Help - SLN2245">Yahoo</a>, etc.) consider metrics such as bounce-rate when they're trying to determine
  rankings.&nbsp; If a lot of people visit to your Web site, spend a mere mattr of seconds and leave without interacting with any other Web pages, what's that
  indicate to search engines about your Web site?
</p>
<p>
  It tells them that your Web site doesn't provide any real value to your visitors.

  Rather than spending your time and money trying to get non-targeted people to your Web site, why not join an online business-oriented community where you

  Generally speaking, traffic organically finds its way to me.
