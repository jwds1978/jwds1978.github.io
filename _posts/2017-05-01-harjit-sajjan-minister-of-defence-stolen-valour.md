title: "Harjit Sajjan, Minister of Defence, Stolen Valour"

<p>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Harjit Sajjan has his &quot;full confidence&quot;, amid a growing controversy over the defence minister's exaggerated
  claim, that he was the &quot;architect&quot; of a major assault on the Taliban in 2006.&nbsp; Interim Conservative Leader, Rona Ambrose, accused Sajjan of
  &quot;stolen valour&quot; for taking credit for the actions of another &#8212; and, called on Trudeau to fire him, for dishonouring himself and the military.
</p>
<p>
  Defence Minister, Harjit Sajjan, formally apologized for his &quot;mistake&quot; in describing his role within Operation Medusa during Question Period on
  Monday.&nbsp; He said that the statement didn't intend to diminish the great work of the Forces.&nbsp; Ambrose, said:
  <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-tories-accuse-harjit-sajjan-of-stolen-valour">
    How much more does the prime minister need to hear, before he understands, why our men and women in uniform have lost confidence in the minister?
  </blockquote>

<p>
  To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to thin about this, in particular.&nbsp; The bullshit claims made by Harjit, aren't simple mistakes, that one may have
  confused with actuality&hellip;&nbsp; He &#8212; straight-up &#8212; lied about his service record.&nbsp; He's our fucking Minister of Defence &#8212; we
  expect better from somebody in his position &#8212; he should know fucking better, as a soldier, as a police officer, and as a defence minister!&nbsp;
  Personally, I'd not think it out-of-line, to expect his resignation and/or dismissal as our Minister of Defence.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Sajjan's claim in India, to be an &quot;architect&quot; of the Afghan campaign, wasn't the first time in which he'd characterized his role in such a
  way.&nbsp; On a regional British Columbia podcast, in July 2015, he said that General Vance considered him to be a central figure.
