  People, often, ask me what I miss about serving in the military&hellip;&nbsp; My answer &#8212; the camaraderie.
</p>
<p>
  All this craziness going on within our country makes me want to go back into the military.&nbsp; Asian, black, disabled, female, from big city or small town,
  gay/lesbian, latino, male, short, tall, white&hellip;&nbsp; It didn't matter what the fuck you were &#8212; we worked side-by-side and respected each
  other.&nbsp; We all had our opinions and disagreements, but respect is what kept us united &#8212; especially, during times of combat.
</p>
<p>
  I'm saddened to see the shit that goes on in Canada.&nbsp; At least, what most of the news portrays today anyhow.
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  I've been out of the military since circa 2000.&nbsp; And, to this day, I've not found the bond, camaraderie, discipline, and/or work ethic that I'd witnessed
  first-hand while serving in uniform.&nbsp; When returning to the civilian sector, you may very well find it difficult to relate and/or work with others
  &#8212; it's not uncommon.&nbsp; I speak to veterans on a daily basis and hear this on numerous occasions &#8212; even, from older veterans.&nbsp; Of course,
  we're in changing times, but this isn't the first time going through this escapade.&nbsp; It's beyond my belief that people still can't respect one another's
  opinion and try to find some common ground.
</p>
<p>
  For us veterans, coming from a disciplined life in uniform, all of this can really have an impact on our lives.&nbsp; Especially, when it comes to being an
  employee and/or student.&nbsp; A student veteran that I've spoken to, just recently, has been separated from the military for less than an a year.&nbsp; To my
  surprise, at our last meeting, she was on her way to going back into the Navy &#8212; stopping her education short, to return to where she felt
  comfortable.&nbsp; Her reason was quite simple:
  <blockquote>
    I cannot relate to civilians after years of military service.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  This could be you, and if so, you're not alone.&nbsp; For many of our combat veterans, separating from the military and entering the civilian world, is a path
  many aren't comfortable taking on.&nbsp; For these veterans, simply being wounded is stress enough&hellip;&nbsp; But, imagine now, having to start your life
  all over in an ever-changing civilian world.&nbsp; Thankfully, there are organizations out there for our disabled veterans that can continue to give them that
  sense of service to their country.
</p>
<p>
  The decision to take a leap of faith into any risky adventure takes a myriad of personality traits &#8212; such as courage, tenacity, and trust.&nbsp; You're
  always facing hurdles requiring strength and challenges needing creativity.&nbsp; However, going it alone for the length of your journey is incredibly
  exhausting &#8212; and, foolish.&nbsp; That's why there's no such thing as a one man army or a truly one man company.
</p>
<p>
  In the military, you work together, train together, patrol together, fight together &#8212; you do everything together.&nbsp; Doing this for a career,
  instills a strong sense of community and shared experiences that's bonded by trust.&nbsp; I can go years without seeing a military friend and immediately know
  that he/she has my back if I needed the help.&nbsp; Some friends will help you move out of your apartment, but others will help you bury a body.&nbsp; This is
  a common military <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}#cite-dysphemism" rel="me" title="Dysphemism">dysphemistic</a> point&hellip;&nbsp; I don't ever intend
  to be in a situation where I have to bury someone or something.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

</p>
<p>
  This shared sense of camaraderie is crucial in picking teams that endure tough endeavors.&nbsp; This may be more of a positive consequence of being from the
  military and not technically a &quot;trait&quot; &#8212; but, it's still something that's closely associated with both the start-up world and being a
  veteran.&nbsp; Therefore, it's important to discuss.
</p>
<p>
  Like the military, you have to work with a team or you'll fail.&nbsp; No &quot;buts&quot; here&hellip;&nbsp; Fact.&nbsp; You have co-founders and/or
  employees, accountants, lawyers, investors, advisors, board members.&nbsp; The team's large and extensive.&nbsp; You'll be closer to some than others.&nbsp;
  Especially, your co-founder(s).&nbsp; So, reaching out to them and working with them through your difficult moments for a positive effect can have some great
  benefits in the long run &#8212; one of them, being a sense of camaraderie.&nbsp; It's a fantastic perk of being part of something noble and everyone should
  look forward to these kinds of intrinsic rewards.
