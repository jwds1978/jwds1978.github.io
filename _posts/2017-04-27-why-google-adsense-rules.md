  Perhaps, one of the best ways to make money blogging is by displaying advertisements on your Web blog.&nbsp; There are many ad networks available &#8212;
  AdSense, Chitika, Infolinks, VigLink, etc.&nbsp; Obviously, we can't clutter our Web blogs with too many ads though.&nbsp; So, we need to choose the best
  &#8212; most effective &#8212; program(s) available.
</p>
<p>
  AdSense is a Google product. It enables us to show contextual ads on a Web site.&nbsp; It's, probably, the best ad network available for any Web site.&nbsp;
  There are people making, quite literally, thousands of dollars every day using AdSense alone.

  Benefits of Google AdSense
</h3>
<p>
  One of the primary benefits of AdSense, quite simply, is the fact that it's a legitimate program &#8212; from Google.&nbsp; When we speak about making money
  from a Web site, the easiest method of doing so, is to implement AdSense on your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  When people click on the AdSense ads, embedded on your Web site, you'll earn money.&nbsp; Bear in mind though, avoid clicking on the ads on your own Web
  site(s).&nbsp; This is an AdSense policy violation.&nbsp; AdSense is a contextual ad network &#8212; ads will be displayed according to your
  content&hellip;&nbsp; If you're writing an article about Web hosting, you're more likely to see ads which are related to Web hosting and/or domains.
</p>
<p>
  Another way that AdSense displays ads, is by using a cookie-based methodology.&nbsp; Based upon a particular user's search history, targeted ads &#8212;
  which, convert better &#8212; will be displayed.&nbsp; AdSense ensures that your visitors will see advertisements which are targeted to them.&nbsp; As such,
  you should get more click-throughs and higher pay-outs than you may with a different ad network.

  AdSense Over Other Networks
</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Easy to Set-Up
</h4>
<p>
  Once you have an approved AdSense account, all that you need to do is to add the code to your Web site.&nbsp; Once the relevant code has been implemented,
  advertisements will begin to display on your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Recognition
</h4>
<p>
  AdSense is the most highly-rated and recognized advertisement program..&nbsp; However, AdSense doesn't approve all types of Web sites though..&nbsp; They're,
  especially, likely to reject Web sites which are still &quot;under construction&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have AdSense up-and-running on your Web site, it generally means that your Web site's been approved.&nbsp; However, this may not be true in all
  instances though.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  One Account for All of Your Web Sites
</h4>
<p>
  With most advertising networks, you need to manually add all of your Web sites&hellip;&nbsp; And, upon approval of each individual Web site, you can place ads
  on that particular Web site.&nbsp; With AdSense, once you have an approved AdSense account, you can put ads on any Web site which complies with AdSense
  policies.&nbsp; There's no need to set-up individual accounts for differing Web sites.&nbsp; You can also use custom channels to see how your various ad slots
  are performing.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Support
</h4>
<p>
  Unlike other ad networks, AdSense has a vastly wide-range of both advertisers and publishers.&nbsp; AdSense also offers a support forum &#8212; you'll find a
  lot of tutorials on how to increase your revenue therein.
</p>

<h4>
  Payment
</h4>
<p>
  One big problem that you'll face with smaller ad networks, is the method of payment to you.&nbsp; Despite meeting the minimum pay-out limit, you may encounter
  some degree of difficulty in actually getting paid.&nbsp; Moreover, if you do some research, you'll find how many of the ad networks are actually
  fraudulent.&nbsp; AdSense, on the other hand, is rather transparent in terms of payment &#8212; you're unlikely to face any issues getting paid by Google.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  While Google AdSense is one of the best programs for making money with a Web site, I'd advise against it &#8212; or, any other ad network, for that matter
  &#8212; for a business/corporate type of Web site.&nbsp; Given that AdSense is contextual, the ads which it serves are based upon your Web content.&nbsp; If
  your Web site's about technology, cell phones, and other gadgets &#8212; using a contextual network such as AdSense &#8212; the ad network will display ads
  for products that are related to the technology industry and similar to your own product(s).&nbsp; Thus, you'll be providing an opportunity for your
  competitors to leverage their brand, using the AdWords program &#8212; AdSense's sister platform.
</p>
<p>
  If you've just started using AdSense, and also use the Chrome Web browser, you can easily track your AdSense earnings via their Chrome add-on.
