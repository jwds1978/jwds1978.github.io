<p>
  A popular argument to fight the stigma of <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> is to abandon it as a disorder.&nbsp; There have also been
  cases for calling <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> an injury because of damage to the hippocampus.&nbsp; However, this is perhaps, the
  worst piece of evidence&hellip;&nbsp; Such scarring also occurs in bi-polar disorder and throughout the entire spectrum of anxiety disorders &#8212; some
  caused by trauma, some not.&nbsp; The injury moniker's most problematic issue's that it seems to create an acceptable male &#8212; or, females living up to
  male ideals &#8212; not mental illness.&nbsp; Even rape survivors are said to have <abbr title="Military Sexual Trauma">MST</abbr> rather than <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> caused by rape within the military.&nbsp; Why there's any effort to sterilize rape within the military,
  continually, blows my mind.&nbsp; The worst thing about injury and/or trauma titles, is their omission of how paradoxical and complicated Civil War Nostalgia,
  <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>, and Shell Shock have always been.&nbsp; Injuries are often a lot more simple &#8212; rest, ice,
  elevate does very little to your identity.&nbsp; War alters our identity &#8212; what we have, is a persistent disorder, illness, and/or syndrome.&nbsp; Yet,
  anyone who truly understands <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>, grasps how it's the persistence of survival skills into non-survival
  situations.&nbsp; Those survival skills, ultimately, saved our lives &#8212; they also make the mundane and/or routine parts of life harder to manage.

  Syndromes are often permanent and the damage to our brain wasn't instant.&nbsp; It takes years, of overuse of the limbic system, to damage the brain's
  declarative memory &#8212; creating the scaring, as identified by injury advocates.&nbsp; Moreover, calling it a syndrome of survival would explain the
  deep-longing and even nostalgic memory of war &#8212; seeking &quot;the suck&quot;.&nbsp; Although we're damaged, most of us possess some longing to return
  &#8212; even, missing combat and/or trauma.&nbsp; When we act like <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>'s solely an injury, we confuse
  injuries and disorders &#8212; all, because of stigma.&nbsp; Assholes will be assholes, whatever title's used for them.&nbsp; But, calling <abbr
    title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> what it is with respect to trauma's paradoxical complexity, will help us to accept what survival and war
  has done to us.&nbsp; It will also help war survivors in recognizing what they may have in common with rape survivors, and that their persistent problems are
  extremely difficult and life altering, but that they ultimately come from a place of strength &#8212; not weakness.&nbsp; We're all survivors, and we should
  have a better title.

  I realize that this is a controversial topic which many, well-informed and capable, people will disagree about.&nbsp; However, as a combat veteran, I've never
  been able to feel comfortable with any of the other popular titles.&nbsp; The syndrome of survival seems to capture all of the complexity of survival, in
  addition to addressing the lasting syndrome.&nbsp; Survival is a universally respected &#8212; even, celebrated &#8212; aspect of the human experience.&nbsp;
  Connecting our troubled lives to this ultimately positive fact, will encourage growth within all of those affected by trauma.&nbsp; We also need a title, that
  people whom suffer, are more willing to bear publicly &#8212; shifting the conversation, becoming broader and more substantive.&nbsp; A title that should come
  with a stronger sense of pride and empathy from non-survivors.&nbsp; A title that expresses a collective appreciation for what people have survived and the
  baggage that comes from it &#8212; no other title does that in such a way.&nbsp; Survivor's a moniker that captures the fact we're not leaves blown about by
  circumstances.&nbsp; We survived, through merit and resilience, and we can also survive the way that those original experiences have changed us.&nbsp;
  Perhaps, even let our survival motivate us to be something better than we would've otherwise been without our horrible experiences.
