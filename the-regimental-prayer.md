  Almighty God; we humbly implore thy blessing on The Royal Canadian Regiment and all of us who serve therein.&nbsp; Help us to prove worthy to accept the high
  ideals and traditions of the past; to honour and revere the memory of those who have gone before us; to face our responsibilities in the future, in both peace
  and war, with courage, justice, love, honesty, and faithfulness.&nbsp; Remove all greed, hatred, selfishness, and envy from our thoughts that we may render
  true service to the Regiment and for Thee our God; for our fellow man; and &quot;For Country&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Amen
