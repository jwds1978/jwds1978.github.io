  humbly implore thy blessing on The Royal Canadian Regiment and all of us who serve therein.&nbsp; Help us to prove worthy to accept the high ideals and
  traditions of the past; to honour and revere the memory of those who have gone before us; to face our responsibilities in the future, in both peace and war,
  with courage, justice, love, honesty, and faithfulness.&nbsp; Remove all greed, hatred, selfishness, and envy from our thoughts that we may render true
  service to the Regiment and for Thee our God; for our fellow man; and &quot;For Country&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Amen
