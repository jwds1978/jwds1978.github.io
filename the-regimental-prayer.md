title: "The Regimental Prayer"
---

Almighty God; we humbly implore thy blessing on The Royal Canadian Regiment and all of us who serve therein.&nbsp; Help us to prove worthy to accept the
high ideals and traditions of the past; to honour and revere the memory of those who have gone before us; to face our responsibilities in the future, in
both peace and war, with courage, justice, love, honesty, and faithfulness.&nbsp; Remove all greed, hatred, selfishness, and envy from our thoughts that we
may render true service to the Regiment and for Thee our God; for our fellow man; and &quot;For Country&quot;.

Amen
