James, a Canadian Forces veteran, is an information technology consultant.&nbsp; He's based in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada&hellip;&nbsp; However, he's able to
telecommute globally though.&nbsp; He's willing to travel, upon pre-payment of associated expenses (i.e. airfare, hotel, etc.), as well.

James has been professionally developing software since circa 2000.&nbsp; You may recognize him from cPanel and/or WHMCS.&nbsp; Although he's versed in
<a href="{{ site.url }}/resume#languages" rel="me" title="">several programming languages</a>, he has focused primarily on PHP.

### Content Management Systems
Thanks to the variety of available content management systems, you can build and manage your business' Web site effortlessly.&nbsp; Each day, more and more
addons, plugins, and themes see the light of day.&nbsp; Yet, in many circumstances and usage scenarios, they simply don't prove to be functional enough for
those who aren't satisfied with mediocrity.&nbsp; James can change that state of affairs for you.&nbsp; Entrust him with your system and he will show you
the real magic of automation and customization &#8212; right inside of your favourite CMS.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
### eCommerce Platforms
Online stores are becoming more and more popular with each passing year.&nbsp; Many business branches grow exclusively within the area of the Web.&nbsp; You
can start your journey with eCommerce in mere minutes due to the powerful platforms which are available on the market.&nbsp; You're probably aware of the
fact that out-of-the-box software might not meet all of your expectations.&nbsp; James will really come in handy when you need to automate and/or
personalize your shop to stand out from the crowd and maximize your earnings.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
### Web Development
James writes CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP to make a Web site come alive.&nbsp; From individual business Web sites, to blogs, or even Web apps.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
### Web Hosting Software
To stay competitive in the ever-evolving market of broadly-defined Web hosting &#8212; you can't stay idle.&nbsp; To avoid being left far behind the others,
you should undoubtedly consider using top-of-the-line systems and Web applications.&nbsp; However, since the possibilities they offer are usually not
sufficient for a modern business' needs, this is only half of the battle.&nbsp; James will customize the software for you, to automate your daily tasks
and/or to help you achieve all of your goals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
James is happy to take on most any project&hellip;&nbsp; So, <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact" rel="me" title="">get in touch</a> with him!
