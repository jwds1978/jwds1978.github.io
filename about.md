James, a Canadian Forces veteran, is an information technology consultant.&nbsp; He's based in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada&hellip;&nbsp; However, he's able to
telecommute globally though.&nbsp; He's willing to travel, upon pre-payment of associated expenses (i.e. airfare, hotel, etc.), as well.

James has been professionally developing software since circa 2000.&nbsp; You may recognize him from cPanel and/or WHMCS.&nbsp; Although he's versed in
<a href="{{ site.url }}/resume#languages" rel="me" title="">several programming languages</a>, he has focused primarily on PHP.

&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Content Management Systems:</span>&nbsp; Thanks to the variety of available content management systems, you can build and
manage your business' Web site effortlessly.&nbsp; Each day, more and more addons, plugins, and themes see the light of day.&nbsp; Yet, in many
circumstances and usage scenarios, they simply don't prove to be functional enough for those who are not satisfied with mediocrity.&nbsp; James can change
that state of affairs for you.&nbsp; Entrust him with your system and he will show your the real magic of automation and customization &#8212; right inside
of your favourite CMS.

&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bolder;">eCommerce Platforms:</span>&nbsp; Online stores are becoming more and more popular with each passing year.&nbsp; Many
business branches grow exclusively within the area of the Web.&nbsp; You can start your journey with eCommerce in mere minutes due to powerful platforms
which are available on the market.&nbsp; You're probably aware of the fact that the out-of-the-box software might not meet all of your expectations.&nbsp;
James will really come in handy when you need to automate and/or personalize your shop to stand out from the crowd and maximize your earnings.

&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Web Hosting Software:</span>&nbsp; To stay competitive in the ever-evolving market of broadly defined Web hosting &#8212;
you can't stay idle.&nbsp; To avoid being left far behind the others, you should undoubtedly consider using top-of-the-line systems and Web applications
in.&nbsp; However, since the possibilities they offer are usually not sufficient for a modern business' needs like yours, this is only half of the
battle.&nbsp; James will customize the software for you, to automate your daily tasks, and to help you achieve all of your goals.

&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Web Development:</span>&nbsp; James writes CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP to make a Web site come alive.&nbsp; From
individual business Web sites, to blogs, or even Web apps&hellip;&nbsp; He's happy to take on most any project.&nbsp; So,
