&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/03/07/ignorant-fucktards/2017-03-07_06-25-05_03-02.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fucking junkies leaving their used and uncapped needles, along with all of the other associated paraphernalia, laying around every-fucking-where are bad
enough.  But, like, WTF?!?  Now, the fucksticks are shitting themselves and leaving their shitty fucking clothes just laying around too?  Not
only were there shitty fucking clothes every-fucking-where, but the toilet was full of shit as well.  Seemingly, even the simple act of flushing is too
much for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I’d found a few mornings ago…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/03/07/ignorant-fucktards/2017-03-02_06-30-22_03-02.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’d walked in that morning, upon opening the door, the smell damn near made me fucking puke.  I’ve smelled some bad, and rather unforgettable
regardless of how much you try, things in my life.  However, that was something fucking else altogether.  Honestly, I’d have preferred the smell
of burning flesh and/or hair over what I’d smelled that fucking morning.  Like, fuck; it was intensely fucking strong… With the door having been
closed, it just concentrated inside of the washroom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Stewart</name><email>james.stewart@forces.army</email></author><category term="The Suck" /><summary type="html">This is what I found this morning…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Somone Has Your Password</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/03/someone-has-your-password/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Somone Has Your Password" /><published>2017-03-03T19:38:53-05:00</published><updated>2017-03-04T13:02:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/03/someone-has-your-password</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/03/someone-has-your-password/">&lt;p&gt;So, I received a few e-mails this evening from Google…  Seemingly, somebody in Sarnia has (or, had, rather) the password to my primary Google
account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/03/03/someone-has-your-password/2017-03-04_09-47-29_1080x1920.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured above, is just one of the alerts that I’d received.  There were actually numerous failed attempts to gain access to my account.  All of
them were from the same IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the would-be intruder were, in fact from Sarnia, I only know one person in that area…  At least, that I’m aware of anyhow.  That person
would be my ex-wife, Debra.  And, to be brutally honest, I wasn’t with her for her brains…  She’s a stereotypical blonde woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of who it actually was, they failed miserably.  Nobody has ever, to-date, successfully infiltrated any of my accounts…  And,
that’s not for a lack of trying either.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Stewart</name><email>james.stewart@forces.army</email></author><category term="Hacking" /><category term="Security" /><summary type="html">So, I received a few e-mails this evening from Google…  Seemingly, somebody in Sarnia has (or, had, rather) the password to my primary Google account.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Try Git</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/02/try-git/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Try Git" /><published>2017-03-02T11:41:59-05:00</published><updated>2017-03-02T11:55:08-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/02/try-git</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/03/02/try-git/">&lt;p&gt;Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time; and, without stepping on each other’s toes.  It’s a

&lt;p&gt;At some point, in the near future, I’ll be publishing tutorials regarding various development-centric subjects.  More than likely, they’ll find
themselves embodied as blog entries, living within their own category.  Stay tuned…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Stewart</name><email>james.stewart@forces.army</email></author><category term="Development" /><category term="Git" /><category term="Tutorial" /><summary type="html">Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time; and, without stepping on each other’s toes.  It’s a distributed version control system.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Git Life</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/28/the-git-life/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Git Life" /><published>2017-02-28T17:44:14-05:00</published><updated>2017-03-01T15:18:16-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/28/the-git-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/28/the-git-life/">&lt;p&gt;I picked-up an Asus X541U notebook today…  Getting it on-sale for $200-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve done a stupid amount of coding from my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over the years, using a Bluetooth keyboard and/or mouse, I’ve decided to move
back to a computer.  I’m going getting back to development and other stuff ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I’ll now be, primarily, comitting to Git from my notebook, I’ll be able to sign said commits.  For the moment, my commits originating from
my Note 3 will still be unsigned.  However, all of the ones from my notebook will be PGP-signed though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having forgotten to pick-up a mouse the other day, below is a cheap-ass mouse that I just got from Dollarama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Family Day a holiday, yet Rememberance Day isn’t?  Today is just another excuse for those in the public sector to not work and a day for people
like me to remember how fucked up their family really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left home when I was 16 years old; never looking back.  However, in recent years, I have made overt efforts to reconcile with my family though. 
But, now as then, they showed exactly how little they actually care about me…  As in, not in the fucking least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in my life, I’m done trying.  I’ve long since abandoned all hope for any sort of family reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Stewart</name><email>james.stewart@forces.army</email></author><category term="Family" /><category term="The Suck" /><summary type="html">Lest we forget…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Infantryman’s Arrogance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/10/the-infantrymans-arrogance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Infantryman's Arrogance" /><published>2017-02-10T10:35:19-05:00</published><updated>2017-02-10T10:35:19-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/10/the-infantrymans-arrogance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/10/the-infantrymans-arrogance/">&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall who wrote this as somebody had sent it to me some time ago, but should you though, feel free to comment…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Infantrymen have a pride and arrogance that most Canadians don't understand and don't like.&amp;nbsp; Even soldiers who aren't infantrymen don't
  understand.&amp;nbsp; The pride doesn't exist because we have a job that's physically impressive.&amp;nbsp; It certainly doesn't exist because it takes a higher
  level of intelligence to perform our duties.&amp;nbsp; It's sad and I hate to admit it, but any college student or high school grad can physically do what we
  do.&amp;nbsp; It's not THAT demanding and doesn't take a physical anomaly.&amp;nbsp; Nobody will ever be able to compare us to professional athletes or fitness
  models.&amp;nbsp; And it doesn't take a very high IQ to read off serial numbers, pack bags according to a packing list, or know that incoming bullets have the
  right of way.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  The pride of the infantryman comes not from knowing that he's doing a job that others can't, but that he's doing a job that others simply won't.&amp;nbsp;
  Many infantrymen haven't seen a lot of combat.&amp;nbsp; While that may sound ideal to the civilian or non-infantry soldier, it pains the grunt.&amp;nbsp; We
  signed up to spit in the face of danger.&amp;nbsp; To walk the line between life and death and live to do it again &amp;#8212; or not.&amp;nbsp; To come to terms with
  our own mortality and let others try to take our life instead of yours.&amp;nbsp; We have raised our hands and said, &amp;quot;Take me, Canada.&amp;nbsp; I am willing
  to kill for you.&amp;nbsp; I am willing to sacrifice my limbs for you.&amp;nbsp; I will come back to Canada scarred and disfigured for you.&amp;nbsp; I will be the
  first to die for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  That's why the infantryman carries himself with pride and arrogance.&amp;nbsp; He's aware that Canada has lost respect for him.&amp;nbsp; To many he's a
  blood-thirsty animal.&amp;nbsp; To others he's too uneducated and stupid to get a regular job or go to college.&amp;nbsp; Only he knows the truth.&amp;nbsp; While
  there are few in Canada who claim to have respect for him, the infantryman returns from war with less fanfare than a first down in a high school football
  game.&amp;nbsp; Yes, people hang up their &amp;quot;Support Our Troops&amp;quot; ribbons and on occasion thank us for our service.&amp;nbsp; But in their eyes the
  infantryman can detect pity and shame; not respect.&amp;nbsp; Consider this:&amp;nbsp; How excited would you be to meet the average infantryman?&amp;nbsp; Now compare
  that with how excited you'd be to meet a famous actor or professional sports player and you will find that you, too, are guilty of placing the wrong
  people on a pedestal.&amp;nbsp; You wouldn't be able to tell me how many soldiers died in the war last month, but you'd damn sure be able to tell me if one of
  the actors from Twilight died.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  Yet the infantryman doesn't complain about that.&amp;nbsp; He continues to do his job; to volunteer his life for you, all while being paid less in four years
  than Tom Brady makes in one game.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  It's a job most Canadians don't understand, don't envy, and don't respect.&amp;nbsp; That is why we have pride for the infantry.
