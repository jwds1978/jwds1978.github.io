  Section 3 &#8212; Disclosure
</h3>
<p>
  We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our <a

<h3 id="section-4-payment">
  Section 4 &#8212; Payment
</h3>
<p>
  If you choose a direct-payment gateway to complete your purchase, then the relevant gateway stores your credit card data.&nbsp; It is encrypted through the
  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).&nbsp; Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase
  transaction.&nbsp; After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
</p>
<p>
  All direct-payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like
  Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
</p>
<p>
  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

<h3 id="section-5-third-party-services">
  Section 5 &#8212; Third-Party Services
</h3>
<p>
  In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the
  services they provide to us.
</p>
<p>
  However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect
  to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
</p>
<p>
  For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by
  these providers.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us.&nbsp;
  So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the
  laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
</p>
<p>
  As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal
  information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
</p>
<p>
  Once you leave our store's Web site or are redirected to a third-party Web site or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or <a
    href="{{ site.url }}/terms-and-conditions" rel="me" title="Terms and Conditions">our Web site's Terms of Service</a>.
