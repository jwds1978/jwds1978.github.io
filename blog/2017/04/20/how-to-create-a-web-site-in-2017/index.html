<p>
  Creating your own Web site may seem hard and complex at first sight.&nbsp; Since the Internet is full of different guides and manuals dedicated to this
  particular topic, some of you may be confused or misled by wrongly interpreted information.
</p>
<p>
  I have a question for you, my dear reader!&nbsp; Aren't you tired of bullshit articles on how to create a Web site?&nbsp; Don't you find them useless and not
  detailed enough?
</p>
<!-- excerptBreak -->
<p>
  Personally, I checked numerous articles on this topic, and I found it very annoying when the manual itself looked good but some important details were
  missing.&nbsp; So it looked like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      You take a look at your admin panel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, at the screen capture from the manual, and back at your admin panel&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      Something went wrong.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Basically, that's the reason why I'd decided to work on this article for you.&nbsp; It's time to cut the crap and get it done.&nbsp; This Internet needs a
  hero.&nbsp; Brace yourself, I've prepared an ultimate guide on how to create a Web site for you!
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="183" src="https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/Seinfeld_482x183.png" style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" /></p>
<p>
  Turn off the TV show or movie that you're watching.&nbsp; You're going to finish your Seinfeld episode later.&nbsp; It's time to start creating!
</p>
<p>
  We're about to take-off.&nbsp; Take your seat, it's going to be a long, yet exciting, journey!

  How to Choose a Web Site Platform
</h3>
<p>
  Whenever someone talks about getting a Web site up-and-running, you may hear a 'CMS' abbreviation.&nbsp; This section will explain to you in-detail what a CMS
  is and how you should utilize such a tool.&nbsp; If you already have this basic knowledge, you may just skip this section, and skip ahead in the article.
</p>
<p>
  CMS stands for &quot;content management system&quot;.&nbsp; The main purpose of these systems is helping you manage and modify the content on your Web site
  without touching a single line of code.&nbsp; Basically, the CMS usually includes all of the needed scripts to control your Web site content and to deliver it
  to your Web site visitors.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of different CMSs around.&nbsp; However, within this article, I'll use the most successful and powerful ones.&nbsp; These include:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      WordPress
    </li>
    <li>
      Joomla
    </li>
    <li>
      Drupal
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="271" src="https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/cms-distribution_482x271.png" style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" /></p>
<p>
  I've gathered the needed information about the aforementioned CMSs for you.
</p>
<p>
  As you may have noticed, WordPress covers more than a half of the Web sites on the Internet.&nbsp; Millions of Web developers choose WordPress as their
  primary Web site building platform.
</p>
<p>
  The difference between first and second place is huge, right?&nbsp; Joomla and Drupal hold the second and third places with the proud numbers (10% and
  9%).&nbsp; Let's see why Web developers choose WordPress and why it's better than any other CMS.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="the-better-cms">
  The Better CMS
</h3>
<p>
  Some of you may say that WordPress is just about blogging Web sites and magazines.&nbsp; That's a common misconception.&nbsp; Nowadays, this platform offers
  you much more functionality.
</p>
<p>
  You can use WordPress to start a blog, eCommerce store, landing page, magazine, portfolio, and more&hellip;&nbsp; You can do, literally, most nything.&nbsp;
  This CMS is flexible enough to start a project of any size and complexity.
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="141" src="https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/WordPress_web-sites_482x141.png" style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" /></p>
<p>
  A lot of large projects are built with WordPress.&nbsp; For example:
  <ul>
    <li>
      BBC America
    </li>
    <li>
      New Yorker
    </li>
    <li>
      Variety
    </li>
    <li>
      Wired
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="142" src="https://assets.forces.army/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/NASA_482x142.png" style="border: 0px; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;" width="482" /></p>
<p>
  The credit given by these big brands can be easily explained by the multi-functionality and simplicity of WordPress.&nbsp; It doesn't matter whether you're
  trying to build a Web site for your company or just a small blog for yourself to post news about how good was your breakfast today.&nbsp; WordPress will work
  fine for everything.
</p>
<p>
  Here are the key WordPress benefits:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ease of Use
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personally, I'd say that &quot;take it easy&quot; is an unofficial WordPress slogan which inspires the developers of this CMS to build such a great
          product.&nbsp; You'll not need big 500-page books to study on how to use this CMS.&nbsp; You'll be guided through the installation process by the CMS
          itself.&nbsp; How cool is that, eh?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Then you'll be able to add the functions that you like by adding plug-ins through the admin panel.&nbsp; Each of them can be configured within a few
          clicks.&nbsp; You can go live with your Web site in the blink of an eye.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Truly Responsive and Mobile-Friendly
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once you install WordPress and kick it off with your newly created Web site, you'll not have to worry about how your Web site looks on mobile
          devices.&nbsp; The major part of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">WordPress themes</a> nowadays, is built with all of the latest standards, giving you a possibility to convey your content to your audience
          through mobile devices in the most efficient way.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Just take a look at the best sellers demos and check-out how they look on smart phones and/or tablets.&nbsp; They're specifically designed to meet
          your cross-platform expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      WordPress Web Sites Look Stunning
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is pretty simple&hellip;&nbsp; It really is beautiful.&nbsp; If you don't believe me, feel free to check-out the catalog of the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">premium WordPress themes</a> and you'll
          see what I'm talking about.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These are the key benefits that should be of interest to you if you're a newbie and you're trying to select the correct CMS.&nbsp; Of course, there are plenty
  of other pros in WordPress, but I wouldn't want this article to become all about those though.&nbsp; Let's move on.
</p>
<p>
  Drupal and Joomla are less popular amongst Web developers, but they've still got their market share and their own fans anyhow.&nbsp; I've, intentionally,
  included Drupal and Joomla in one section.&nbsp; They both have very similar cons when compared with WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  One of the biggest problems with these types of systems is their complexity.&nbsp; It's simply harder to work with them&hellip;&nbsp; You need to have a more
  advanced level and knowledge to be able to build a fully-functional and good looking Web site.
</p>
<p>
  All the same, they're listed in the top-3 for a reason.&nbsp; That's why I've decided to provide you with not only one, but three guides.&nbsp; That's right,
  I'll show you how you can create a Web site using any one of these three platforms.
</p>
<p>
  For your convenience, you can decide which CMS works the best for you, depending on your skill and knowledge, and skip to the relevant section of the article.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-domain-and-web-hosting">
  Choosing a Domain and Web Hosting
</h3>
<p>
  Each and every Web site needs a domain name and Web hosting.&nbsp; That's like a home for your Web site.&nbsp; Everybody needs a home, right?
</p>
<p>
  I'm not going to tell you about the possibility to be hosted at wordpress.com for free&hellip;&nbsp; I'm a serious person.&nbsp; Using a subdomain of
  wordpress.com will make your Web site look unprofessional.&nbsp; That's not what we're trying to do.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of Web hosting providers around the Internet.&nbsp; The pricing varies from being as low as Hell to being ridiculously high.&nbsp;
  Personally, I'd suggest that you considering the two Web hosting providers below:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      InMotion
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These guys will give you an opportunity to get Web hosting for a price-point of around $3&#8211;6 USD; a great deal.&nbsp; The best part of it, is that they
  have great servers.&nbsp; And, even for the price, they'll provide you with a good customer service experience.&nbsp; It's very important for everyone who is
  running their own Web site to have a good relationship with their Web hosting provider.
</p>
<p>
  I'd recommend you taking a look at the offers from both <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> and
  InMotion; choosing what will work best for you.&nbsp; For this article, I'll show you how you can sign-up with <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> and host a Web site on their Web servers.
</p>
<p>
  The domain name should be chosen wisely.&nbsp; There are 3 key things to keep in mind while selecting a domain name for your Web site:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>
      The URL of your future Web site is the first thing that the visitor will see.&nbsp; A kick-ass domain name will, definitely, make a great and lasting
      impression.
    </li>
    <li>
      The domain name should be the same as your brand name; or, as close to it as possible anyhow.&nbsp; It will be a huge plus to your brand recognition.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep it simple&hellip;&nbsp; Nobody wants to memorize the domain name.&nbsp; If it's something like &quot;thincrunchpizzafromchicago1259.com&quot;, you're
      going to burn in Hell.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-a-domain-and-web-hosting">
  How to Get a Domain and Web Hosting
</h3>
<p>
  This is where we stop talking and start doing.&nbsp; I've made a step-by-step guide on how you can start working with <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>.&nbsp; Essentially, it will give you a general knowledge that will
  help you to work with InMotion as well because the process is very similar on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, open the <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> Web site.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that they advertise their most popular pricing plan right in the header and they list all of the benefits for you.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Good News
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll get free 24/7 customer service from them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Very Good News
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll get a free domain (.com) for a year!&nbsp; Isn't that great?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Let's click on the &quot;Get Started Now&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that they offer 3 different pricing plans.&nbsp; For you, as a beginner, the Basic plan should work fine.&nbsp; It gives you an opportunity to
  host 1 Web site and gives you 50GB of Web site space/storage.&nbsp; It should cover all of your needs.
</p>
<p>
  Once you click on the &quot;Select&quot; button, under the Basic plan, you'll be redirected to the page where you can select the domain name for your future
  Web site.
</p>
<p>
  You may enter any domain name you want.&nbsp; If it's already been registered by someone else, <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> will let you know; and, even offer some alternative names to work with.&nbsp; As an example, I decided to go with
  &quot;mywebsite.com&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, I knew that such a domain name had already been taken, but the Web hosting provider offered me alternatives to
  consider though.
</p>
<p>
  I decided upon &quot;mywebsitedirectory.com&quot;.&nbsp; That doesn't sound very attractive, but it's just an example.&nbsp; I've already explained to you
  earlier, in a section above, how you should choose the domain name properly.
</p>
<p>
  Now, it's time for you to fill in all of the personal data.&nbsp; Below the account information block, you'll notice the package and payment information
  blocks.&nbsp; That's where you can confirm the plan that you want to go with and select the term.
</p>
<p>
  I shouldn't need to explain how to enter your credit card information, eh?<br />
  &nbsp;<br />

</p>
<p>
  One of my favourite things about <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> is that they offer to install
  WordPress for your in just a few clicks.&nbsp; You'll not have to worry about moving files and/or folders around via the FTP, they'll do everything for you.
</p>
<p>
  You'll only have to fill-in general information.&nbsp; Once you've entered all of that information, you're done.&nbsp; Click on the &quot;Install
  WordPress&quot; button and they'll&hellip; install it for you&hellip;&nbsp; What a surprise, eh?

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-web-site-with-wordpress">
  How to Create a Web Site with WordPress
</h3>
<p>
  When WordPress is installed, you may visit the WordPress admin panel which will be located at the following URI&hellip;
  <ul>
    <li>
      yourwebsite.com/wp-admin
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  You should use the credentials that you have chose while installing WordPress through the <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> admin panel.
</p>
<p>
  Within the WordPress admin panel (i.e. the &quot;Dashboard&quot;), you'll see all of the sections on the left.&nbsp; The window on the right will display all
  of the settings which you can work with.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, we need to change the theme.&nbsp; There are lots of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">great-looking WordPress themes</a>.&nbsp; Feel free to choose one that will suit your individual needs.&nbsp; For this article, I
  decided to use the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a>
  theme.&nbsp; The reason is simple&hellip;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> is a multi-purpose theme.&nbsp; So, it usually works for varying Web site topics.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <iframe allowfullscreen="" height="271" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8NYJFSWZlmI?rel=0" style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to create a Web site using the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> default skin as it's my favourite one.&nbsp; But, here's where it gets better&hellip;&nbsp; You may choose from more than 10+
  skins.&nbsp; That's why <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid
  2</a> is suitable for a lot of different types of Web sites.
</p>
<p>
  In order to change the WordPress theme, you should go to &quot;Appearance&quot; and click on the &quot;Themes&quot; menu option.
</p>
<p>
  It will redirect you to the Web page where all of the installed themes are listed.&nbsp; However, we're not interested in any of those though&hellip;&nbsp;
  They look boring!
</p>
<p>
  In order to install a new theme, you should click on the &quot;Add New Theme&quot; button and upload the template that you want to use.&nbsp; As I've already
  mentioned, I'll upload the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> template.
</p>
<p>
  After the installation process, you should click on the &quot;Activate&quot; button to apply the changes and set the new theme as a default one for your Web
  site.
</p>
<p>
  Once it's activated, the WordPress admin area will show you a tip right above the templates area.&nbsp; You'll see that it offers for you to install the
  &quot;TM Wizard&quot; and that's an excellent tip.&nbsp; You should do that&hellip;&nbsp; You'll see just how useful this tool is.
</p>
<p>
  TM Wizard will offer for you to start the skins installation process.&nbsp; Just click on the &quot;START INSTALL&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
  The Wizard will check if all of your system settings are OK; notifying you if something's wrong.&nbsp; When you see that everything is OK and green, just
  click the &quot;Next&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
  That will take you to the list of all of the available skins.&nbsp; That's where you should decide what skin may work best for your needs.&nbsp; As I've
  already mentioned, I'll go with the default one.&nbsp; So, I just click on the &quot;select skin&quot; button near the &quot;default&quot; skin.
</p>
<p>
  There are two options here for you&hellip;&nbsp; You may select either the Full or Lite installation option.&nbsp; The Lite one can be used in case you don't
  have much Web site space with your Web hosting.&nbsp; So, by choosing the Lite installation option, you agree to getting a lesser amount of the blog posts and
  other demo data.
</p>
<p>
  If you selected <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>, you don't have to worry about it, just proceed
  with the Full Installation option.&nbsp; It should work perfectly fine for you.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the installation wizard will download and install all of the needed plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
  In order to install the demo data, you should agree that you want the sample data to replace the existing data on your Web site.&nbsp; Essentially, this
  warning was added just in case you're installing this theme on a Web site where you already have lots of old content.&nbsp; That's something like a trigger
  for you to have a turning point and save your data.
</p>
<p>
  Since my WordPress Web site is new, and it doesn't have any data, I don't particularly care whether my posts will be replaced or not.&nbsp; So, I agree and
  select the &quot;Replace My Existing Content with Demo Content&quot; option.
</p>
<p>
  WordPress won't be able to perform this without having you enter the admin password.&nbsp; That's because such important decisions should be confirmed on your
  side&hellip;&nbsp; Such a destructive action should be confirmed prior to proceeding.
</p>
<p>
  It may take some time now, the wizard will import all of the sample data for you&hellip;&nbsp; Making sure that your Web site looks great and operates
  as-needed.
</p>
<p>
  Once everything has been installed, you'll have a Web site that looks like our demo unit.&nbsp; You'll have all of the data imported.&nbsp; I believe that
  it's time to start the customization process.
</p>
<p>
  Let's go to the Dashboard and start editing the home page.&nbsp; In order to do that, you'll need to visit the &quot;Pages&quot; section and select the
  &quot;Home&quot; page.
</p>
<p>
  You'll be redirected to the Web page with the power builder.&nbsp; That's my favourite tool which helps you to customize your Web site by simply moving around
  the block of content from within the builder itself.&nbsp; I'm happy that <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> includes the power builder.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <iframe allowfullscreen="" height="271" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XgfsP79dkzA?rel=0" style="border: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="482"></iframe>
</p>
<p>
  I removed the slider from the header section of the Web site and decided to go with one image at the top.&nbsp; Once you've removed the slider itself, you'll
  need to click the &quot;Insert Module&quot; button and select the &quot;Image&quot; module from the modules list.
</p>
<p>
  That's just the beginning&hellip;&nbsp; Let's go deeper and get our hands dirty.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to change the logo to the one that I've prepared in PhotoShop.&nbsp; In order to update the logo, you should click on the &quot;Customize&quot;
  button within the top panel of your Web site.&nbsp; An additional menu will be opened on the left side of your Web browser window.
</p>
<p>
  Just click on the &quot;General Site Settings&quot; &raquo; &quot;Logo &amp; Favicon&quot;, and upload the logo that you want to use, rather than the generic
  <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> logo.
</p>
<p>
  While scrolling the newly created Web site, containing demo data, I realized that I'll not need the &quot;GPL3 License Advantages&quot; block.&nbsp; So, I
  simply went to the power builder tab and deleted it.
</p>
<p>
  I also don't like the &quot;Buy Theme&quot; button.&nbsp; This button strikes the eye and calls-to-action.&nbsp; That's why I'll change the button to
  &quot;Order a Story&quot;.&nbsp; This will work perfectly.&nbsp; It will give the customer a chance to order the Web site content, or any other service, right
  here and right now.&nbsp; Oh, how I love call-to-action buttons&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  In order to perform this change, you should go to the &quot;Header&quot; menu option.&nbsp; Then, go to &quot;Header Elements&quot;.&nbsp; Change the text of
  the call-to-action button and click on the &quot;Save &amp; Publish&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
  Since we're working with the header, let's change the menu items.&nbsp; I'll create the menu items that will take the clients to the following pages:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Contacts
    </li>
    <li>
      Home
    </li>
    <li>
      Portfolio
    </li>
    <li>
      What We Do
    </li>
    <li>
      Who We Are
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  I think that these are the Web pages which will give the customers all of the needed information about the company.
</p>
<p>
  In order to add these menu items, I had to go to the &quot;Menus&quot; &raquo; &quot;Main&quot; and remove all of the existing menu items.&nbsp; Then, I added
  all the menu items that I'll need, and linked them to the relevant Web pages that I'd created on the dashboard within the &quot;Pages&quot; section.
</p>
<p>
  As you can see, we've already changed the way that the homepage looks once the customer views it.
</p>
<p>
  Let's change the introductory text that goes right after the image.&nbsp; In order to do that, we should go back to the power builder, and open the settings
  of the &quot;Text&quot; module; right after the &quot;Image&quot; module.
</p>
<p>
  That's where we can fill in the information about the company and explain to the customer who we are and what we do.&nbsp; I wanted to tell the customer that
  we, simply, deliver good content and working with us is worth a try&hellip;&nbsp; There's no need to add a 5-page long read with a full history of the
  company.
</p>
<p>
  There's a block within the default skin of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a> where the main pros of the template are listed.&nbsp; We'll use this block to advertise the 3 primary services:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Content Marketing
    </li>
    <li>
      Creating Web Site Content
    </li>
    <li>
      Speech Writing
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Let's go to the power builder and scroll to the module containing the 3 &quot;blurb&quot; modules.&nbsp; We can edit the content of each module by clicking on
  the settings icon to the right.&nbsp; You can choose the body text, icon, and title for each service&hellip;&nbsp; It's fairly simple.
</p>
<p>
  If you open the power builder, you'll see that there are two similar rows on the homepage.&nbsp; They both include the &quot;Text&quot; module, but it's
  located on different sides of the page though.&nbsp; I decided to remove the second one; leaving only the first one.&nbsp; Since I'd moved the
  &quot;Services&quot; block above, closer to the introduction text, now I have two blocks with the gray background and it doesn't too look good.
</p>
<p>
  As such, I'll change the background and image for this block.&nbsp; I'll set the background to a white colour and add a picture that will be more appropriate
  for the Web site.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to let the customers know that we're responsible for one of the speeches that have been a part of the President's fundraising event.&nbsp; There's
  also a block within the Projects showcase.&nbsp; I believe that we'll need this one on the Web site.&nbsp; So, I'll change the pictures to examples of the Web
  sites for which we've created the content for.
</p>
<p>
  Let's go to the power builder.&nbsp; Click on the options button near the &quot;Projects&quot; module and we'll see that all of these projects are taken from
  the &quot;Project&quot; category.
</p>
<p>
  So, we'll need to go to the &quot;Projects&quot; category on the left side of the Dashboard and change each-and-every project or simply remove the old ones
  and add the news ones in their place.&nbsp; That's quite simple and looks like the regular blog post edit page.&nbsp; The featured image can be changed on the
  right and the body text is located in the middle.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to move the &quot;Testimonials&quot; module above the &quot;Projects&quot; module.&nbsp; It's very easy to do from within the power builder.&nbsp;
  You can re-order the modules by moving them around using drag-and-drop.&nbsp; So, now they'll be above the &quot;Projects&quot;, but we need to change the
  testimonials to suit the company though.
</p>
<p>
  In order to do that you'll have to go to the &quot;Testimonials&quot; section within the WordPress Dashboard and change each testimonial.&nbsp; Basically, it
  looks like you're editing an article.&nbsp; As the company I'm using for this article is fictitious, I simply changed the company name within the
  testimonials.&nbsp; However, you'll have to add your own testimonials from real customers though.
</p>
<p>
  The only issue now, is the &quot;Represent Your Staff&quot; title that's located here for whatever reason.&nbsp; I'd like to change it to something more
  appropriate.&nbsp; Let's go to the power builder.&nbsp; Select the &quot;Cherry Testimonials&quot; module and enter the text that you want to see there.
</p>
<p>
  I don't want to have all of these widgets in my footer.&nbsp; So, I'll remove them.&nbsp; We can do that by going back to the &quot;Customize&quot; menu and
  selecting the &quot;Widgets&quot; option.&nbsp; Simply, remove all of the widgets from within this area, and click on the &quot;Save &amp; Publish&quot;
  button.
</p>
<p>
  I believe that it looks great and I'd not say that iif it were hard to work with <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes/monstroid2.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Monstroid 2</a>.&nbsp; You can set-up a working and good-looking Web site within a day or so.
</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-web-site-with-joomla">
  How to Create a Web Site with Joomla!
</h3>
<p>
  The installation process of the Joomla! CMS will be a little tricky.&nbsp; That's because not all of the Web hosting providers offer a 1-click
  installation process for Joomla!.&nbsp; So, you'll need to move the files via FTP on your own, and also create the database on your own.
</p>
<p>
  But, don't be scared though&hellip;&nbsp; It's not so hard.&nbsp; I'll show you everything and walk you through the installation, step-by-step.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, you'll need to download the <a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/latest" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="Latest :: Joomla! Downloads">latest Joomla! package</a>.&nbsp; You can do it on the <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-joomla-downloads" rel="me" title="Joomla! Downloads">Joomla! official Web site</a> since Joomla! is a free and open-source project.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've downloaded the <a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/latest" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="Latest :: Joomla! Downloads">latest
  Joomla! package</a>, you should unpack it and move the files to your <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> FTP.
</p>
<p>
  Just click on the &quot;File Manager&quot; button from within your <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>
  control panel.&nbsp; Then, click on the &quot;Home Directory&quot; option and submit your request.&nbsp; That will take you to the root folder, to which you
  should upload the Joomla! package.
</p>
<p>
  In order to install any CMS, you need to have the database.&nbsp; Let's create one for your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  Now, we can start working on the Web site.&nbsp; Prior to that I'd suggest for you to check-out the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/joomla-templates.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">premium Joomla! templates</a> and pick one for
  your future Web site.
</p>
<p>
  One of the pros of such and approach is that the template comes with a so-called &quot;quick-start package&quot;&hellip;&nbsp; And, that's an amazing feature.
</p>
<p>
  It's a Joomla! package that has the template pre-installed.&nbsp; In order to get a good-looking Web site, with all of the demo data, you'll only need to
  agree to the sample data installation.&nbsp; That's as easy as pie.
</p>
<p>
  I've decided to show you how to work with Joomla! using the best template, <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/jumerix-multipurpose-joomla-template-60060.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Jumerix</a>.&nbsp;
  It's a multi-purpose template that has a few homepage layouts and a lot of pre-designed solutions.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s begin our work!&nbsp; I'll create a Web site for a digital agency here as well.&nbsp; I believe that creating the Web sites on the same topic, but with
  different CMSs, will give you an understanding of how good it can get on each CMS.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've moved everything via FTP, and created the database for your Joomla! Web site, you can proceed with its installation.&nbsp; Open your Web site and
  you'll be redirected to the installation page of the Joomla! CMS.
</p>
<p>
  That's where you fill-in the general information.&nbsp; You also have the option to shut-down your Web site from the very beginning.&nbsp; It means that while
  you work on your Web site, no one will have a chance to see it in an unfinished state.&nbsp; If they open it, they'll be presented with a maintenance message.
</p>
<p>
  The next step includes filling-in the database information.&nbsp; During the last step, you should choose the &quot;Install Sample Data&quot; &raquo;
  &quot;sample_theme3311&quot; in order to have all of the demo data automagically installed.
</p>
<p>
  One of the interesting things about the Joomla! installation process is that it always asks you to delete the &quot;Installation&quot; folder from your Web
  site.&nbsp; In the older versions you had remove it yourself via FTP, but now you can just simply click on the &quot;Remove Installation Folder&quot; button
  and the CMS will do it for you.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/jumerix-multipurpose-joomla-template-60060.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">This template</a>
  also has a few more homepage layouts.
</p>
<p>
  Essentially, all of the changes are performed from within the administrator panel of the Joomla! CMS.&nbsp; You can sign-in at following URI&hellip;
  <ul>
    <li>
      yourwebsite.com/administrator
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  There, you'll have to fill-in the data that you'd entered during the installation.
</p>
<p>
  All of the menus are located on the top panel and all of the settings will appear in the window area below.&nbsp; Of course, the standard slider images don't
  fit the company.&nbsp; So, let's change the images and text.&nbsp; Go to &quot;Content&quot; &raquo; &quot;Articles&quot; and filter the articles by the
  &quot;Slider&quot; category.&nbsp; You'll see 3 articles that are used in the slider.&nbsp; Each article includes images and text.
</p>
<p>
  Let's change the title and the picture on the &quot;Images and Links&quot; tab.&nbsp; The slide text can be changed on the first &quot;Content&quot;
  tab.&nbsp; You can edit the rest of the slides in the same manner.
</p>
<p>
  Now, we need to change the logo and set the one with the agency name on it.&nbsp; It will be the same one that I'd used in the WordPress tutorial.&nbsp; Let's
  click on &quot;Extensions&quot; &raquo; &quot;Templates&quot; &raquo; &quot;Styles&quot;.&nbsp; Click on the &quot;theme3311-Default&quot; style and you'll be
  redirected to the settings page.&nbsp; That's where the logo can be changed.
</p>
<p>
  It's time to change the &quot;What We Offer&quot; block and to add the appropriate information therein.&nbsp; All 6 items within that block are articles and
  you can change them by going to &quot;Content&quot; &raquo; &quot;Articles&quot; and filtering them by the &quot;What We Offer&quot; category.&nbsp; I won't
  need all 6 items.&nbsp; So, I'll unpublish 3 of them; leaving the other 3.
</p>
<p>
  Each and every item can be edited like a regular article.&nbsp; So, you can put the title and body text there.&nbsp; It gets a little tricky when you want to
  change the icons.&nbsp; In order to change the icon for each item, you'll need to go to the &quot;Images and Links&quot; tab; changing the icon code within
  the &quot;caption&quot; field.
</p>
<p>
  You may be wondering, &quot;where can we get the icon codes?&quot;&nbsp; These are the codes of the <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-icons-font-awesome" rel="me" title="Icons :: Font Awesome">Font Awesome icons</a>.&nbsp; You can review the huge <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-icons-font-awesome" rel="me" title="Icons :: Font Awesome">library of their icons</a> on the official Font Awesome
  Web site.&nbsp; Choose the one which you like and that fits the topic of your Web site.&nbsp; Once you click on the icon, you'll be able to get the icon
  code.
</p>
<p>
  Now we need to change the introductory text of the &quot;What We Offer&quot; block.&nbsp; In order to do that, we need to go to &quot;Extensions&quot; &raquo;
  &quot;Modules&quot; and search for the &quot;What We Offer&quot; modules.&nbsp; You'll have a listing of modules with the same name.&nbsp; The one that we
  need is the last one on the list&hellip;&nbsp; The one that's located on the &quot;navigation&quot; position.
</p>
<p>
  Once you start editing it, you'll see the &quot;Pretext&quot; field on the bottom of the page.&nbsp; That's where you should enter the text that you want to
  be displayed in-place of the demo text.
</p>
<p>
  Now, it's time to unpublish the blocks that we don't want to see on our page.&nbsp; First of all, let's disable the &quot;Flexible Pricing&quot; module.&nbsp;
  Just go to &quot;Extensions&quot; &raquo; &quot;Modules&quot; and unpublish both of them.&nbsp; Now, let's turn off the rest of the unnecessary modules in the
  same way that we did with the pricing block.
</p>
<p>
  Let's go to &quot;Content&quot; &raquo; &quot;Articles&quot; and search for the &quot;You and Your Business Look Ravishing&quot; article.&nbsp; Once you've
  found it, feel free to edit it as-needed.
</p>
<p>
  But the picture isn't located within the article though.&nbsp; We'll have to look for the module that displays that picture with the parallax effect.&nbsp; Go
  to &quot;Extensions&quot; &raquo; &quot;Modules&quot; and look for the &quot;Home Parallax&quot; module that's located on the &quot;showcase&quot;
  position.&nbsp; Open it and upload your own picture that you want to see there.&nbsp; Make certain that the picture is in a PNG format and has a transparent
  background.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will look ridiculously bad.
</p>
<p>
  Now let's change a little bit of the module that displays the texts about how the company works.&nbsp; Go to &quot;Extensions&quot; &raquo;
  &quot;Modules&quot; and search for the &quot;How We Work&quot; module.&nbsp; There are a few modules with the same name there.&nbsp; You'll need to open the
  one on the &quot;none&quot; position.&nbsp; As you can see, this module is linked to an article with the same name.&nbsp; Just click on the &quot;Edit&quot;
  button and you'll be able to edit the article right from there.
</p>
<p>
  As you may have noticed, the top menu panel and the footer have a background image, and as of right now, it doesn't really fit the style.&nbsp; I decided that
  the top panel should be black and the footer should be dark grey.&nbsp; We can change these settings within the template.css file of the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/jumerix-multipurpose-joomla-template-60060.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Jumerix</a>
  template.&nbsp; Go to the folder with the template via FTP and open the &quot;template.css&quot; file within the CSS folder.
</p>
<p>
  Look for the &quot;#top&quot; ID and comment or remove the background image.&nbsp; Then, add the following line:
  
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">  <span class="nt">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">#000000</span><span class="o">;</span>
  </code></pre></figure>

  Now, I think that the top panel looks sick!
</p>
<p>
  You can change the footer colour in the same way.&nbsp; Look for the &quot;#copyright-top&quot; ID and comment or remove the background image line.&nbsp;
  Then, simply add the following line:
  
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">  <span class="nt">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">#1a1b1d</span><span class="o">;</span>
  </code></pre></figure>

</p>
<p>
  The last thing to do, is to change the main menu.&nbsp; That's very easy to do.&nbsp; Just go to &quot;Menus&quot; &raquo; &quot;Main Menu&quot; and add the
  links to the Web pages that you want to display.&nbsp; For me, these are all the same as found within the WordPress tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="how-to-create-a-web-site-with-drupal">
  How to Create a Web Site with Drupal
</h3>
<p>
  The installation process is simple and quick.&nbsp; <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-drupal" rel="me" title="Drupal">Drupal</a> doesn't want to
  scare you away right from the beginning.&nbsp; Everything looks exquisite and convenient.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've filled in the database information, don't forget to open &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; and enter the database hostname.&nbsp; That's the host
  address which you can obtain from your <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/how-to-create-a-web-site-in-2017/#cite-bluehost" rel="me" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> control panel.&nbsp;
  Drupal, usually, sets this field value to a default value of &quot;localhost&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've given Drupal all of the information, the installation process is over.&nbsp; You'll be redirected to the homepage of your newly created Web
  site.&nbsp; It will have a generic Drupal theme.&nbsp; So, we're not done yet.&nbsp; Let's take <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/drupal-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">a beautiful theme</a> and install it properly&hellip;&nbsp; It's very easy!
</p>
<p>
  In order to install a new theme, you should go to &quot;Appearance&quot;.&nbsp; You'll be redirected to a Web page with the list of available themes.&nbsp;
  Click on &quot;Install New Theme&quot; and choose the ZIP archive of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/drupal-themes/tax-advisor-corporate-business-drupal-template-63401.html" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">the theme</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've set the new theme as a default one, you'll see that your homepage now looks different.&nbsp; It has a new logo now and the colour scheme is
  different.&nbsp; However, it doesn't look like the demo, eh?&nbsp; That's because we have to perform one more step to finish the theme installation process.
</p>
<p>
  Now, we need our Web site to have the demo data installed.&nbsp; In order to do that, we have to go to our phpMyAdmin panel.&nbsp; Let's click on your Drupal
  database (everybody will have a different name).&nbsp; That will take you to the Web page with all of the tables available within your database.&nbsp; But,
  we're not looking for those.&nbsp; We need to import some data.
</p>
<p>
  Click on the &quot;Import&quot; tab and &quot;Select the File&quot;.&nbsp; Now, we'll have to select the SQL file from the ZIP archive of your theme.&nbsp;
  Let's get back to your Web site and log-in to the admin panel.&nbsp; Just go to the URI&hellip;
  <ul>
    <li>
      yourwebsite.com/user
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Once you've installed the theme, the username and password will be set to a default of:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Password:&nbsp; admin123
    </li>
    <li>
      Username:&nbsp; admin
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  You may change this setting or create a new user through the admin panel later.&nbsp; So, no worries.
</p>
<p>
  We can apply changes to the structure of your Web site by adding, changing, and/or removing the block in the &quot;Structure&quot; &raquo; &quot;Blocks&quot;
  admin panel section.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to remove the top panel with the contact information and move the &quot;Follow Us&quot; section to the &quot;Menu&quot; panel.&nbsp; It looks cute,
  eh?
</p>
<p>
  Now, it looks obvious that we need to change the slider background because this picture doesn't really work for the company.&nbsp; In order to do that, you
  should go to &quot;Appearance&quot; &raquo; &quot;Settings&quot; &raquo; &quot;Region Settings&quot;.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Select Media&quot; and upload your
  image.&nbsp; Now, it looks way better&hellip;&nbsp; It fits the topic of your future Web site.
</p>
<p>
  I think that it's time to change the text within the slider.&nbsp; In order to do that, you may go to &quot;Structure&quot; &raquo; &quot;Blocks&quot; and
  click on the &quot;Configure&quot; button right by the &quot;Header Block&quot; row.
</p>
<p>
  Since we're working with the header section of the Web site, it's time to work with the menu.&nbsp; You can do it by going to the admin panel and clicking on
  &quot;Structure&quot; &raquo; &quot;Menus&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  We'll see the listing of the menu items.&nbsp; I decided to remove the &quot;Documentation&quot; menu item.&nbsp; I also decided to rename the &quot;About
  Us&quot; item to &quot;Who We Are&quot; and the &quot;Services&quot; item to &quot;Why Us&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  We've already done the menu, slider, and social links.&nbsp; Now it's time to upload a new logo.&nbsp; I decided to save the same colour scheme.&nbsp; So, the
  new logo will have a green element to it.
</p>
<p>
  We need to change the projects to suit the digital agency topic.&nbsp; You can change each project on the main page easily enough.&nbsp; Just open the project
  and click on the &quot;Edit&quot; tab.
</p>
<p>
  As you can see, the introduction text fits the demo topic only.&nbsp; Let's change it.&nbsp; It's even simpler&hellip;&nbsp; You can just hover over this
  block and click on the edit button; filling-in the data that you want.
</p>
<p>
  We'll need the core features module as well.&nbsp; It's a great way to showcase the main services of your company.&nbsp; I decided to advertise 3 core
  features for the digital agency&hellip;
  <ul>
    <li>
      Content Marketing
    </li>
    <li>
      Creating the Web site Content

  You can change the feature's look by going to &quot;Content&quot; and editing the articles from the &quot;Services&quot; category.

<p>
  I don't want the Web site to have the latest news block.&nbsp; So, I'm going to go to &quot;Structure&quot; &raquo; &quot;Blocks&quot; and disable all of the
  blocks that I don't want to see on the Web site.
</p>
<p>
  Now, let's go to &quot;Appearance&quot; &raquo; &quot;Settings&quot; &raquo; &quot;Region Settings&quot; and change the footer image.&nbsp; It's optional, but
  I have an image that I'd really like to see right there.&nbsp; So, I decided to put it to a good use.

  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  Let's wrap-up by summarizing the information that we've gathered.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to build a Web site of any complexity, whether a huge store or a small blog, a landing page or a magazine, you can use WordPress and you'll be
  more than happy with the number of great features that this CMS has to offer.&nbsp; It's unbelievably easy-to-use and it's also very easy to understand it and
  learn how to work with it.
</p>
<p>
  There are plenty of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">premium WordPress
  themes</a> around the Internet.&nbsp; So, you'll not have to worry about how you can make your Web site stand out.
</p>
<p>
  Working with Drupal and Joomla, probably, won't make you that happy.&nbsp; But, they certainly have their pros though.&nbsp; Joomla is a little bit more
  complex.&nbsp; Drupal is as complex as Hell.&nbsp; So, keep it in mind, while choosing the right CMS for your Web site.
</p>
<p>
  The pool of <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/drupal-themes.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Drupal themes</a> and <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/joomla-templates.php" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Joomla premium templates</a> is a little bit
  smaller due to the fact that a smaller percentage of users prefer these platforms.&nbsp; However, you can always find some ready-made solutions for those
  anyhow.
</p>
<p>
  I've created this extensive article for you and hope that it will help you to create your first Web site without any issues&hellip;&nbsp; Just keep calm and
  create great Web sites!
