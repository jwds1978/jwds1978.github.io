  <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>'s a life-long endeavor &#8212; there's no cure for it.&nbsp; The triggering traumatic event changes
  the landscape of the mind &#8212; it no longer works in the same fashion that it did before.&nbsp; The mind's been rewired &#8212; the neuropathways have been
  altered into a continuous loop.&nbsp; The <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>-triggering incident converts the fight or flight response

<p>
  The incident that solidifies the mental wound of <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>, results in a mind-numbing and/or psychic
  shift.&nbsp; In response to the trauma of combat, the person needs to make a mental detachment to do &quot;what needs to be done&quot;.&nbsp; The survival
  mode of operation forgoes the higher levels of functioning and depends upon the primitive reactionary portion of the brain.&nbsp; When this unconscious
  detachment's been activated too frequently and/or for extended periods of time, it becomes part of conscious processing and interferes with everyday
  interactions.&nbsp; <a href="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-dissociative-mind" rel="me" title="The Dissociative Mind">According to Howell</a>,
  dissociation refers to:
  <blockquote cite="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-dissociative-mind">
    the separation of mental and experiential contents that would normally be connected.&nbsp; The word dissociation is laden with multiple meanings and refers
    to many kinds of phenomena, processes, and conditions.&nbsp; Dissociation is both adaptive and maladaptive, both verb and noun, both cause and
    effect&hellip;&nbsp; Dissociation is often psychologically defensive, protecting against painful affects and memories, but can also be an organismic an
    automatic response to immediate danger&hellip;&nbsp; Dissociation can be understood as taxonic or, varying in degrees&hellip;&nbsp; It is both occurent and
    dispositional&hellip;&nbsp; It refers to such psychical events as spacing out, psychic numbing, and even experiencing oneself as floating above one's
    body.&nbsp; Dissociation has been thought of in spatial metaphor, as acts of &quot;keeping things apart&quot; as well as &quot;vertical splitting&quot;.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The mind can develop into split affective regions, where multiple self-states dissociate incompatible values systems and set-up residence, along with
  establishing a unified substructure within matching internal guidance systems.&nbsp; The dissociated subsystems run parallel to other self-states, emerging
  when a particular skill set needs asserting pertaining to situational interactions.&nbsp; Here, trauma based disorders may lead the symptomology to further
  entrenchment and compartmentalization that may lead to personality disorders.
  <blockquote cite="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-dissociative-mind">
    A war veteran with <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> might have more significant structural dissociation, involving the sequestration
    of more and larger portions of experience.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  A defined pre-conditioned set of beliefs and values, the combat schema, enables the warrior to navigate efficiently through the adversity of combat without a
  detailed consideration of consequences.&nbsp; I propose a unique set of beliefs, Combat Values Theory (CVT) &#8212; based upon the survival of self in
  relation to the context of war and the &quot;combat-othering&quot; &#8212; for we must wholly demonize our adversary, and in the process, dehumanize
  ourselves.&nbsp; The combat veteran's primitive fight or flight defensive mechanism's been repressed through training in the military, conditioning the troop
  to take-up the fight portion, leaving a proclivity for violence without a concern for personal safety.&nbsp; To engage in a mortal fight with the enemy, this
  schema spells out the actions in a given situation &#8212; without becoming preoccupied with survivability in the moment &#8212; which, could get a soldier
  killed.
</p>
<p>
  The warrior with <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>'s grown accustomed to the value and belief systems of war, and feels threatened when
  they become faced with having to let go of this security, in an attempt to reintegrate back into society.&nbsp; Howell describes animal defensive and
  post-traumatic biological states:
  <blockquote cite="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-dissociative-mind">
    The human animal may have a repertoire of discrete behavioral states that are adaptive to conditions of predation&hellip;&nbsp; These animal defense states
    may underlie different dissociative parts of the personality&hellip;&nbsp; This begins a neurophysiological alarm reaction&hellip; and&hellip; a tendency to
    over read cues as threatening, which can increase the probability for violence.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The ambiguity inherent in social dynamics can lead to mixed feelings and/or even a lack of feelings, depending upon the degree of interpersonal relatedness to
  the returning combat veteran (RCV).&nbsp; We rely on our parental figures, to shape healthy personality and value structures, through attachments with
  significant others &#8212; the attachments become avenues of exchange, a distillation of proper interactions, and expectations according to society
  norms.&nbsp; When this exchange becomes distorted to the point of the child becoming a repository of negative energy, instead a healthy exchange solidifying
  proper boundaries, then the nature of our attachments may become warped and disorganized &#8212; further compounding the RCV's reintegration.
</p>
<p>
  The combat attachments, born of blood, don't leave us because we depart the battlefield &#8212; they become an empty feeling inside of us.&nbsp; The soldier
  develops a highly narrow functioning self-organization in conjunction with his/her other squad members.&nbsp; This organization &#8212;
  &quot;troop-organism&quot; &#8212; becomes an extension of the combat-self&hellip;&nbsp; No different, than an arm or a leg.&nbsp; We don't will our arms
  and/or legs to move, we react from the expectations of intentional imagery based upon the combat values structure.&nbsp; It happens, such as the members of
  the &quot;squad-herd&quot;, where each part of the troop-organism and acts in a homogeneous way &#8212; each troop becoming part of the others self-states.
</p>
<p>
  These attachments to the other, require a splitting within the interpersonal self-states, where many such dissociated selves birth into existence.&nbsp; As
  each of the value system constructs don't match, and out of necessity, develops into a complete compartmentalized persona while maintaining the
  &quot;whole&quot; sub-self organizations.&nbsp; Each of the self-states run parallel to one another and have the capacity of switching back-and-forth when the
  proper situation requires appropriate specialized skill sets.&nbsp; The interpersonal-self of the civilian-self becomes supplanted and filed away, by the
  combat-self, due to the incompatibility of the value structures for survivability that requires a conforming from a civilian society to the norms of the
  combat environment.
</p>
<p>
  Attachments can be considered the path to rigidity or vehicles of spontaneity &#8212; to become spontaneous, the person must develop a mechanism for the free
  exchange of intimacy, through beneficial interpersonal skill sets.&nbsp; Without a healthy development of attachments, then disorganized attachments (i.e.
  d-attachments) form.&nbsp; The d-attachments become the mechanism to gauge interactions in the environment, and in doing so, they become rigid &#8212; an if
  this then that experiential existence.&nbsp; The d-attachment arraignment only allows for what can be controlled under a series of contingencies plans and/or
  procedural knowledge &#8212; usually, modeled after our parental attachments &#8212; an identification with the aggressor and/or other such negative role
  model.&nbsp; Becoming an identity of an exclusionary &quot;personal culture&quot;, where the individual becomes estranged from regular society and defending
  their boundaries, as they were national borders between two hostile countries.
</p>
<p>
  The cycle of procedural enactments play-out in significant others that we allow in our lives&hellip;&nbsp; The reason why we keep having the same
  dramatizations and/or arguments, while never finding a resolution.&nbsp; We enact our past roles and project them into our relationships, cast from our
  childhood, in an attempt to resolve the attachments constructively.&nbsp; Since we haven't been shown healthy attachment enactments, we reside in the cycle of
  d-attachments and further compound our disorders through retraumatization and/or neglect, predisposing the person to develop trauma based disorders and/or
  personality disorders.
</p>
<p>
  Without a reintegration of the self, and of attachments and d-attachments, a combat veteran can and will run afoul of friends, family, and society.&nbsp; The
  returning combat veteran faces hurdles that they haven't been trained to handle.&nbsp; The training and experiences that they've navigated and survived will
  lead them to think that a civilian life will be easy as compared to the battle-life.&nbsp; What they fail to realize though, is that they've replaced their
  civilian-self with an operational combat value system and attachments &#8212; where in society, the individual has the utmost consideration, further combining
  and compounding issues of integration.&nbsp; Little concentration on developing healthy attachment systems, the untenable situation can leave the RCV with
  severely dysfunctional interpersonal skills and a mechanism of perpetual isolation.

<p>
  Combat alters and/or modifies the value system, a preconditioned set of beliefs, entailing a value-orientated constitute of definitions of situation in terms
  of direction of solutions and action dilemmas, formulating a culture of killing &#8212; stripping the combat vet of the niceties that lubricate society's
  interactions &#8212; which, in combat, would result in death.&nbsp; In combat, the fluidity of boundaries becomes awash in the relational adaptation to an
  integral cohesion with their battle buddies &#8212; a devolution of survival mind-set develops and provides a sense of safety &#8212; the germination of base
  natural selection process by successful integration of the combat value system.&nbsp; With a disproportionate number of Army veterans incarcerated, the Army
  culture seems to generate people more prone to violence.
</p>
<p>
  The war-zone recons the birthing of the &quot;trooper organism&quot;, where the firing squad becomes integrated with one another, with a culture of
  survival.&nbsp; The individual boundary of the soldier, submerges within the organismal boundaries of the trooper organism, while shedding the individual
  identity.&nbsp; The troop organism allows for the diffusion of immense responsibility across all involved, making the transition to an evolution of survival
  more manageable, wherein the herd mentality brings forth the primitive instinctual remnants and the decentralization of obligation.&nbsp; Military culture
  portrays the combat arms as having more cultural capital and esteem.&nbsp; Infantry with combat decorations, increases the rate of promotion, rank, and/or
  respectability &#8212; non-combat soldiers tend to be overlooked.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<h3 id="situational-imprisonment">
  Situational Imprisonment
</h3>
<p>
  Military enculturalization subsumes CVT into an identification, born of survival and dependent upon the assimilation of the &quot;firing squad mind set&quot;,
  where one troops thoughts relate to an extension of their battle buddies.&nbsp; The fluidity of boundaries, births the &quot;troop organism&quot; and forever
  impairs the RCV to return home without his &quot;other selves&quot;.&nbsp; Now, the RCV has to try and interrelate without his relational attachments, and
  attempts to reintegrate back into the civilian world where nothing makes sense anymore &#8212; where boundaries cross without attachments, as a normative
  experience, triggering perceived threat-states.&nbsp; This leads the RCV to become his own &quot;isolated island organism&quot; and/or an identity incomplete
  without the other part of the firing squad that thinks, feels, and acts as they do.&nbsp; The RCV becomes unable to interrelate with family and/or community
  in a meaningful way, impeded by the fluidity of boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  As their safety's been compromised, a feeling of abject detachment has arisen from the conditioned reality of the combat organism, which depended upon the
  battle buddy &quot;having his back&quot;.&nbsp; Therein, leading to a sense of safety &#8212; the combat vet needed only to worry about their own personal
  &quot;line of sight&quot; in a battle field environment, requiring a 360&deg; threat radius.&nbsp; On his own, in society, this burden becomes an impossibly
  overwhelming sense of danger &#8212; engulfing the RCV, leading to a susceptibility to triggers.&nbsp; A culture of 360&deg; radius in the battlefield and
  shackled intimately with the culture of combat values, hereinto relying on the troop attachments and the evolution of survival, the RCV becomes stuck on the
  troop-organism functionality.
</p>
<p>
  The troop-organism capacity becomes problematic to the integration of the &quot;civilian-self&quot; as it now has become supplanted by the
  &quot;combat-self&quot;.&nbsp; An attachment of the self to the self that's the identity of one whom sufficiently succeeds in suffering, completing the
  veteran and familial rift.&nbsp; The fluidity of boundaries, in an intimate relationship with a loved one, becomes a threat to the RCV &#8212; due to the
  misidentification of signals between the two &#8212; one having adapted an independent perspective and the other a dysfunctional dependent state.&nbsp; The
  crossed-signals of the significant others has complicated the adaptation from independent relational skills verses over-dependence and the perceived
  threatening self states with both parties expectations of returning to &quot;the way it was&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Compounding the issue, the RCV's now been conditioned to the &quot;culture of killing&quot; and the relational fluidity of boundaries between the two have
  become incompatible, further giving rise to the RCV's sense of threat, as if he where in combat.&nbsp; In combat, a registering between non-compatible
  boundaries would be reconciled by a reflexive reactionary exercise of survival, triggering the culture of killing.
  <blockquote cite="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-place-of-culture-in-forensic-psychiatry">
    Those supporting the use of culture as a defense argue that is it intrinsically unfair to judge someone exclusively by the rules and values of a society
    that he or she does not know.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The above, speaks to the creation of a Veterans Court, where culture competency would require a special understanding of combat vets cultural
  &quot;shaping&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  With our modern soldiers averaging 2&#8211;3 tours of combat, we'll begin to see an increasing epidemic of incarcerated veterans.&nbsp; Within the next
  10&#8211;15 years, the public will see a sharp rise in veterans suffering from <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> &#8212;to the point of
  epidemic proportions.&nbsp; You see, never before in war, have our troops been subjected to such prolonged exposure to combat and life-threatening
  situations.&nbsp; In World War II, our troops were fighting a defined enemy while engaging real objectives &#8212; with sufficient downtime between
  engagements.&nbsp; Most of the troops to see combat were infantry soldiers, fighting on a distinct front, not the ones &quot;in the rear with the
  gear&quot;.&nbsp; With a real threat to the sovereignty and way of life, soldiers of this era were less affected by the trauma of war.
</p>
<p>
  The significant political interference of the Vietnam War, generated little to no tangible objectives for our soldiers, solidifying and branding their levels
  of anxiety and forever troubling their minds.&nbsp; Guerrilla warfare, an inherently cognitively-damaging military action compounded the neuropathic damage
  experienced by troops in Vietnam.&nbsp; Even with the troops having regular downtime between engagements, the cognitive fractures of these veterans were
  enhanced by more intense combat and the rejection of the returning soldiers.
</p>
<p>
  The soldiers in the Iraqi war have been sent on multiple deployments, with an average of 2&#8211;3 tours of duty, with little time between deployments.&nbsp;
  While in Iraq, there are no friendly countries nor areas in which to spend leave time, in order to relieve stress while residing on constant alert.&nbsp;
  Most, even non-combat soldiers, see combat and/or threats on a daily basis.&nbsp; Now, combine this with the most intensive warfare possible &#8212; guerrilla
  warfare &#8212; in an urban environment.&nbsp; We get troops that are over-extended and/or over-exposed to life-threatening situations within unprecedented
  levels of combat.&nbsp; Troops in Iraq have no respite from danger, further entrenching the effects of <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> through the hyper levels of neurotransmitters.
</p>
<p>
  Dissociated attachments reenact combat trauma somatically, and between interstates within the RCV, resulting in a &wuot;civil war&quot; amongst oneself.&nbsp;
  A seemingly supra-intelligent guidance of the unconscious, this device of <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> that engages in the
  survival defensive mechanisms that have sustained the combat veteran's life on a persistent basis.&nbsp; Thus, becoming the protector&hellip;
  <blockquote cite="https://jwds1978.github.io/blog/2017/05/10/the-modern-combat-veteran/#cite-the-dissociative-mind">
    A conceptualization of hostile self-states in &quot;personified narcissistic and sociopathic defenses&quot; that defend against dependency, vulnerability,
    and guilt&hellip; and&hellip; applies just as well to pathological narcissism.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  The &quot;diminished capacity&quot; rule would apply when dissociative episodes result in a &quot;psychotic&quot; break.&nbsp; Whereby, a thought disorder
  could be ascribed.
</p>
<p>
  Never before, in the history of warfare, have we seen such high numbers of soldiers who've been under unimaginable stress.&nbsp; During WWII, 18% of soldiers
  actually engaged in combat &#8212; with Vietnam, it was 30&#8211;40% &#8212; today, 68% have actually engaged in combat.&nbsp; Not only have more soldiers
  engaged in combat, they've been in combat longer, with an average of 2&#8211;3 tours of duty.&nbsp; Many, have been on 5 tours &#8212; some, as many as
  6.&nbsp; As high as 80&#8211;90% of soldiers have seen someone get killed and/or have been in a combat zone&hellip;&nbsp; We've reached a point of
  &quot;combat saturation&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Today, 15% of soldiers and veterans have been diagnosed with <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; This appears as though it may be
  a smaller number as compared to other wars.&nbsp; 30% <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> rates in Vietnam, 15% estimated in WWII, and
  15&#8211;20% of Gulf War vets reported to have <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; It took Vietnam veterans up to 10&#8211;20
  years before their symptoms reached the point of becoming debilitating.&nbsp; The implications for our modern veterans will have monumental and deleterious
  effects within the next 10 years.&nbsp; It's been projected, that <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> rates in today's wars, will reach
  50&#8211;60%.&nbsp; We'll be inundated with mentally ill veterans who have few options and nowhere to turn &#8212; they'll run afoul with the law.
</p>
<p>
  Today, we've become faced with a growing trend of soldiers and veterans becoming enmeshed within the court systems.&nbsp; In direct conflict with the
  perception in the media, I propose the theory that our veterans and soldiers face insufficient mental health care &#8212; having a major impact to their
  lives, families, and communities.&nbsp; The problem isn't individualistic, but systemic, requiring major changes in how we view and treat <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>.&nbsp; The care of our soldiers and veterans isn't being met and we've just begun to see the aftereffects
  of the mind-shattering results of combat trauma.&nbsp; Untreated <abbr title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr> can destroy the lives of many
  &#8212; not only the soldier and/or veteran.&nbsp; We send our soldiers to war and then lock them up when they're broken and are no longer of use.
